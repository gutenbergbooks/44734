<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Since the Great European War broke out,
printing presses have been busy producing
text books, handbooks and guides
for soldiers. Military authorities and civilians
alike have come to realise that this war has
changed many of our old conceptions of
strategy and that it has introduced conditions
that are entirely unprecedented. New methods
have had to be devised&mdash;sometimes on the field
itself in the midst of the greatest difficulties&mdash;for
meeting new and novel methods of warfare.
Every deadly engine of destruction has
called forth some new invention to cope with
it. Soldiers have had to live and fight under
conditions that to the lay mind, or to the mind
of the military men of a few years ago, would
seem to be impossible. It is reasonable to
assume that the inventive genius of the world
will be turned more and more in the direction
of the problem of how to construct still more
terrible machines of destruction. The next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
war, if there be one, is not likely to be any less
fearful than the present, so that the soldier
who is called upon to engage in it will require
to know the lessons that have been
learned in this war. The author hopes that
from a fairly long training in England in
preparation for work in France, and from
some months in the trenches on the Western
British front, he may be able to offer suggestions
that will be of value to men who are training
themselves with a view to becoming efficient
soldiers. He sends this little book forth,
not as a treatise on war, nor yet as a scientific
handbook. He merely desires it to serve to
bring home lessons that are sometimes too
dearly bought. "Experientia docet" is the
proverb that we used to write in our copy
books, and he will feel that he is repaid if, from
his experience, others are enabled to learn.
While he trusts that there will be many veteran
soldiers and instructors who will be glad to
have this information in convenient form, he
intends this little book primarily for the use of
those who are civilians in the process of becoming
soldiers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
THE CIVILIAN AND THE SOLDIER</h2>


<p>The change from civilian to soldier is one
that is not easily accomplished. We
soon find that there are many new conditions
to be faced, many new and uncongenial
tasks to be undertaken, and all sorts of strange
and novel regulations to which we must render
the strictest obedience. In civilian life we become
thoroughly independent. We come and
go more or less as we please. We do not usually
ask the permission of any one if we wish
to depart a little from our customary habits.
Not since we left school have we answered to
roll-calls to any considerable extent, and only
in the summertime, "for the fun of it," have
we done our own housekeeping and submitted
to domestic duties. In civilian life we have
been allowed to work out our own salvation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and if we have been part of a machine at all
it has been a huge social machine in which we
did not figure as a cog but rather as an attachment.</p>

<p>In military life things are all changed. We
become at once cogs in the great machine. We
have a definite work to perform. The smooth
running of the plant depends on <i>us</i>. We lose
much of our independence. We realise that
other cogs depend on us, and, further, that
there are many bigger cogs who drive us and
whose bigness and authority we must thoroughly
appreciate and recognise. In my own
experience, after some years of being my own
master to the degree that only the professional
man understands, I found it much to my dislike
to be obliged to get permission before I
could leave the camp grounds for half an hour.
A sentry with a fixed bayonet helped me a little
in the appreciation of my new circumstances,
and when in a few days' time I was the sentry
myself, it did me the world of good and took
the edge off my displeasure. Again it is not
to the liking of the ordinary man to be told
that he must rise at a certain hour, and much
less is it to his liking to be told that he must
be in bed at a certain hour after which talking
is considered a misdemeanour and is punishable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
<i>But</i> a few weeks of enforced early
rising makes one give thanks for the pure fresh
air of the small hours of the day; and a few
days of hard physical exertion in the process
of training makes a man glad to conform to
the rule of early to bed, and gives him reason
to class as a nuisance the man who talks after
"Lights Out" and thus prevents him from
sleeping.</p>

<p>In civilian life, too, a man usually chooses
with scrupulous care his roommate or mates.
In the army one may be placed in a tent or
a billet with men who are by no means congenial,
unless he is lucky enough to have been
able to join a group of companions who form
a unit. But even the experience of having uncongenial
companions is not altogether without
its compensations; for every civilian finds that
he has need of rearranging his estimates of
men when he enters the army. The sooner our
own corners are rubbed off the better, and
many of them are inevitably rubbed off when
we are ten or thirteen in a tent!</p>

<p>The quality that is the salvation of the volunteer
is his keenness. We volunteer <i>because</i> we
are keen and we would be ashamed to be otherwise.
The rules and regulations of army life
are liable to try our tempers and our patience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
There may come times when we question very
seriously the wisdom of having "joined up."
There may be occasions when we thoroughly despise
our seniors and conclude that everything
military was arranged for our oppression.
Bit by bit we shall lose the conviction that we
"know it all" already, and as knowledge increases
within us, we shall appreciate more and
more the knowledge and experience of those
placed over us. Regulations and even red tape
will be seen to have a wise purpose, though, to
the end of our days, we may long for some official
scissors to cut it.</p>

<p>The change from civilian to soldier is produced
in one way only&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Learning of
Obedience</span>. This is the first and last lesson.
The civilian is only obedient in certain ways
and to a limited extent. The soldier is obedient
in every way and to any extent, even to
death. It would be wrong of me to indicate
that "the habit of implicit obedience" comes
easily to the average man. It is difficult to
acquire. But it is the "sine qua non" of a
good soldier and <i>must</i> be acquired. It is the
heart of the system. Obedience is given to
some one by every rank in the army, from the
highest general to the humblest private.</p>

<p>When we have learned obedience we need to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
learn discipline&mdash;for the two words do not mean
exactly the same thing. Discipline may be of
two kinds. First of all there is <span class="smcap">Self-Discipline</span>.
This includes the restraint of selfishness;
the cultivation of the spirit of comradeship,
generosity and thoughtfulness; the
cultivation of habits of moderation in smoking,
drinking, etc.; and the elimination of those vices
that tend to rob us of our strength or impair
the clearness of our thinking. Then there is,
secondly, <span class="smcap">Army Discipline</span>, which includes
obedience, thoroughness, common sense and resourcefulness.
This question is dealt with at
length in military handbooks and needs few
words from me.</p>

<p>The point to remember is that training for
modern war is a serious business, not to be
entered upon lightly, nor regarded as a
"cinch." A man must first of all be fit in body
to be able to withstand the many physical hardships
that he will be sure to encounter. Then
he must be fit in mind to provide him with the
imagination and the resourcefulness that he will
certainly be called on to show. His heart must
be strong not only in the opinion of the surgeon
but in the opinion of those who judge his "all-round
manhood." He must be trained in such
a way that he will be able to stand not only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
physical but the nervous strain as well. A visit
to the hospitals in England and France will
provide the spectacle of row after row of beds
containing men who have never been wounded
but whose nerves have gone to pieces in the
strain of modern warfare.</p>

<p>Remember to take your training seriously&mdash;it
pays.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
HEALTH</h2>


<p>Benjamin Franklin once said, "Be
sober and temperate and you will be
healthy." This is in the main true and
is excellent advice for the soldier. But there are
ills that are liable to affect the fighting man in
spite of his temperance and sobriety and of
these we must speak.</p>

<p>The health of men in the army is, on the average,
much better than that of individuals outside
of it. This is due to many causes chief of
which is the fact that only healthy men are admitted
to the army. Then the out-of-door life,
regular and wholesome food, sufficient exercise
and "early to bed and early to rise" tend to
keep him well. If he enters the army fit, he
must make it his business to remain fit and it
will be well to remember that "an ounce of prevention
is worth a pound of cure." To preserve
good health is his <span class="smcap">Duty</span> for only thus can he become
an efficient soldier. If the bodily resistance
is weakened, man becomes prey to the millions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of germs that are to be found in the air
and even within his own system. When he is
healthy the body is able to keep them in subjection,
but once let him permit his system to run
down and these armies of microbes will attack
him with all their forces.</p>

<p>Now let us begin first of all with <span class="smcap">Bodily
Cleanliness</span>. No soldier can come on parade
unless his face and hands be clean. Shaving,
though sometimes a bore, is an excellent method
of keeping the face clean and fresh. It tends to
smarten a man, and officers are not slow to pick
out the careful from the slovenly soldier. We
used to reserve the unpleasant tasks of the
camp&mdash;latrine duties amongst others&mdash;for men
who would not keep their hands and faces clean.
But there are other parts of the body to which
it is just as necessary to apply cleansing methods
regularly even though no military punishment
follows the violation of the rule. First of
these that I would mention is the</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teeth.</span> Soldiers, I find, are very careless in
this matter till the first thing you know is that
someone is absent from parade because of the
toothache. On one occasion in the trenches,
when we were very short handed, an officer had
to leave us for a week to go to the hospital with
a badly abscessed tooth due entirely to neglect.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Cleaning the teeth night and morning freshens
the mouth and makes food taste better. An
excellent custom is to rinse the mouth after
every meal, and while this may often be inconvenient
it can be done if a soldier remembers to
wash his mouth out with the first sip of water
every time he takes a drink. If the teeth are
allowed to get very bad a man's digestion suffers
and he falls ill. This robs the army of part
of its fighting strength, a result which every
soldier has an interest in avoiding.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Hair.</span> No better advice can be given to the
soldier on this subject than "cut it short." The
shorter the better, for when it is short it is
easy to keep clean both from body dirt and vermin.
In this war soldiers have almost invariably
had the clippers run completely over their
heads. Soap and water are as good for the head
as for any other part of the body.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trunk.</span> It is not always possible for soldiers
to get a shower or plunge every day, but a small
sponge carried as part of the equipment will
help a good deal. In France, where the water
was scarce, we had to make it go a long way.
When the enemy permitted, I used to get my
regular morning bath with the aid of the sponge
and about a saucerful of water. I felt like a
canary during the process and wanted to chirp<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and flap my wings. Soldiers should be encouraged
to go in swimming whenever circumstances
permit. To go in swimming was not a military
order in my regiment, but we used to take the
men to the sea and then ask who wanted to go
in. About eighty per cent of the men would
volunteer. Then we would tell off the remaining
twenty per cent for vigorous physical exercises
and after ten minutes give them the choice
of continuing or taking a plunge in the sea.
They all went in! Men's objections to water
usually come from habit and they soon learn to
appreciate its refreshing power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Feet.</span> "An army marches on its stomach"&mdash;metaphorically,
but it marches on its feet, literally,
as every poor infantryman knows. And it
has to do a good deal of marching in war and
in preparation for war. "Route Marches" and
"Hikes" are very popular with the training
staff as the soldier will find, and they are usually
planned by the men who ride horses! So
important did we consider the care of the feet
that we used to have "<span class="smcap">Toe Parades</span>" twice a
week with the Doctor in attendance. Men with
neglected feet were considered as candidates
for cookhouse garbage duty, and were promptly
assigned to this task. In the first place feet
must be comparatively clean&mdash;soap and water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
recommended! Then they should be free from
corns. This is not so easy to accomplish. Paring
with a knife helps, but if they get too bad
the doctor or the chiropodist should be consulted.
Another frequent source of trouble is
neglected toe nails. The best way is to cut
them straight across, not too far down, but so
as to keep them from tearing the sock or cramping
the foot in the boot. Blisters sometimes
arise on the feet. They should be treated at
once, mainly by removing the cause&mdash;which may
be in the boot itself or the sock&mdash;and then by
bathing them in a solution of boric acid. If the
socks are kept oiled, or even if small pieces of
soap are put into the boots, this condition will,
in large measure, be avoided. I have seen many
a pitiful case of men trailing along the road
well in rear of their company, limping and hobbling
as best they could, all due to the fact that
they had not paid the attention to their feet that
they must if the feet are to do the work for
which the army calls.</p>

<p>A few minutes attention per day given to
these points will, I am confident, help to procure
and maintain health for the soldier. But
all his care will be wasted unless that which he
takes <i>inside</i> his body is wholesome&mdash;food and
drink. In camps the soldier usually has all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
food cooked for him, and it is the duty of his
officers to see that it is good in quality, sufficient
in quantity, and reasonably well cooked.
As the soldier does the serving himself, that is
entirely his own lookout. In the trenches it is
not possible to have things arranged as one has
in camp. The regimental cookers were usually
stationed about three miles from the firing line&mdash;for
their safety&mdash;and all the food was cooked
there and sent up to the lines in boxes or sandbags,
and apportioned to the various platoons
according to the number of men on the strength.
Three times a week the cooks were given fresh
meat to prepare for us&mdash;when the Government
says it is fresh it is fresh even in Summer time
and when the flies have been busy&mdash;and for the
other days we subsisted on canned meats or
"bully beef" as it was called. The meat was
either baked or boiled, though sometimes we
got a stew&mdash;in camp we got too many stews!
Potatoes were boiled, usually in their jackets.
This food we could heat in the trenches in our
individual cooking apparatus, which also served
to cook our ration of bacon for breakfast, while
in the upper part of the tin we made tea.</p>

<p>Of course in the trenches we had to eat whatever
we could get, but our lot was relieved considerably
by the arrival of delicacies from England
by the parcel post. This sometimes subjected
us to the temptation that we were under
while in training, and that was to eat pastry and
suchlike food, which, while very appetising, is
not to be recommended as a diet for the soldier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>On the question of <span class="smcap">Drink</span> my views have become
very pronounced since my experience with
the army. Undoubtedly the best universal drink
for the soldier is tea&mdash;preferably weak. I
should say water were it always possible to get
water that is pure. But during a campaign pure
water is a luxury. By making the water into
tea you make sure that it gets boiled, and by
the addition of tea you get a beverage that has
not the insipid sickly flavour of boiled or sterilised
water. Coffee is preferred by Americans,
I know, but there are dangers to be recognised
especially by those whose hearts are inclined
to be weak.</p>

<p>With regard to alcohol I would most heartily
recommend total abstinence. I need scarcely
remind American readers that there is not a
single front rank baseball manager that allows
his men to indulge in alcohol. From my own
experience I could tell of many men who were
permanently rendered unfit as soldiers through
foolish indulgence. Of the men who were
brought before the Colonel for more or less serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
crimes, 90 per cent of them owed their humiliation
directly to alcohol, and 5 per cent of
them to alcohol indirectly. I know that it is possible
for some men to take alcohol in moderation.
Not many continue to do so, and sooner
or later there is almost certain to be an overindulgence.
In the British army men were sentenced
to the extreme penalty&mdash;death&mdash;for being
intoxicated while on active service in
France. I say without hesitation that the best
men I had were the abstainers and the worst
men I had were the drinkers. Alcohol weakens
the tissues of the body, it lowers its vitality and
makes it an easy victim to disease, and worse
still, it rapidly obscures the mind. For a war
of the kind that is being waged in Europe a man
needs to have his head very clear, and this he
cannot do if he is the victim of the alcohol habit.</p>

<p>Many total abstainers from alcohol are
tempted to take "gassy" drinks, fizzes and so
forth. These tend to shorten the wind and
should therefore be avoided.</p>

<p>If plain water has to be drunk, care should
be taken to see that it is reasonably pure, and
all vessels such as water bottles should be thoroughly
rinsed each time before using.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>When these simple rules of eating and drinking
are followed many of the dangers incidental
to army life will be avoided, and physical fitness
established.</p>

<p>A kindred subject is that of <span class="smcap">Smoking</span>. This
habit has become so universal in the British
army that it is almost true to say that every one
smokes. From my own experience I have seen
very few ill effects from it except in cases of
obvious overindulgence. But undoubtedly it
is easy to overdo the cigarette business, and on
this point I would utter a word of warning.
Pipes are to be preferred, though I admit it is
difficult to get men to smoke anything else than
cigarettes in the trenches. In the monotony and
strain of trench life, and from the need to do
something to keep the stench of decaying bodies
from the nostrils, men do smoke to excess.
There is some excuse there, but during training
at home every man must endeavour to be reasonable
in his indulgence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clothing.</span> I have found that men are very
apt to load themselves up with all sorts of useless
items of apparel. In their endeavour to
keep warm they have often badly overdone it
with the result that they have found themselves
perspiring and exhausted in the midst of an important
piece of physical labour. Of course the
soldier will need to see to it that his underclothes
are sufficiently warm to keep out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
extreme cold, but it is better to <i>add</i> something
to the clothing from time to time&mdash;such as a
Cardigan waistcoat&mdash;than to be equipped permanently
with the heaviest kind of underclothes.
Above all, avoid those garments that
are being offered extensively to unsuspecting
men, and which, while they will undoubtedly
keep you warm, will also prevent the proper
perspiration of the body. The body <i>must</i> be
allowed to perspire and the air must be allowed
to carry off the perspiration. Woollens are the
best for this purpose, and though the initial cost
of them is rather great, they are worth it in the
long run.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boots.</span> In the paragraph on feet I couldn't
help mentioning the matter of boots, but it is
so important that, at the risk of too great repetition,
I want to mention it again. You must
have boots that are right, otherwise you will
soon be lamed and thus be out of action. And
every man out of action "counts two on a division."
We found it advisable in France to get
boots that were large enough to accommodate
the feet and <i>two</i> pairs of socks&mdash;one thin and
one thick pair. Into the boots we poured a
small quantity of oil, or between the socks we
put small pieces of soap to keep the feet in good
condition. You will find that the feet must be
oiled if they are to stand the work of a campaign.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>But sometimes injuries are caused to the feet
by other parts of the clothing of a soldier. Men
frequently laced their puttees or leggins too
tight and found that they suffered pains in the
feet&mdash;the circulation was being stopped. This
rendered them very liable to frostbite, than
which there is nothing more painful. If there
are signs of freezing, remove the boots as soon
as possible and restore the circulation. But if
the feet are actually frozen the soldier is in for
a long and tedious illness, and will be lucky if he
does not need to have his feet amputated. I am
told that, during the first campaign in the Carpathians,
the Central Powers lost 25,000 men
per day with frozen feet.</p>

<p>Before leaving this subject to deal with diseases
and their avoidance, I would like to say
a word or two on the congenial subject of <span class="smcap">Rest</span>.
A soldier should get as much of it as he can,
consistent, of course, with doing his duty.
Never stand when you could as well be lying
down. Throw yourself on the ground whenever
you can, to rest, and let the whole body relax.
When you are given a rest on the roadside,
stretch out on your back and breathe as deeply
as you can. Give your mind and body alike a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
vacation and you will feel the benefit of it at
the end of the day. Don't spend your hours of
beauty sleep in talking&mdash;get that done during
the day. Your body will call for rest after the
tiring duties of the day and you should give it
all the rest you can.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
DISEASE</h2>


<p>If the rules of health set forth in the foregoing
chapter are carefully observed, the
soldier will be doing the best he can to keep
his body fit. He will be building up a reserve
of strength that will stand him in good stead
should the germs of disease find entrance into
his body. But there are times when, in spite
of all our precautions, these little microbes get
the upper hand, and a long struggle against
them begins. The disease that has been responsible
for the death of armies of soldiers is
<span class="smcap">Enteric</span> or <span class="smcap">Typhoid</span> fever. During the campaign
in South Africa the British lost more
men through the ravages of this disease than
through bullets and shells. But during the
present war there have been comparatively few
cases of enteric, and the number that have
proved fatal is very small. For this result we
have to thank the medical profession that has
given so much study and care to the perfection
of a method of combating this disease. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
secret has been found to lie in the inoculation of
the soldier with small doses of the disease itself
till he becomes comparatively immune to it. Inoculation
was not made compulsory in the first
armies that were raised in England after war
broke out, but it was made compulsory for men
who desired to become members of the British
Expeditionary Force in France. Most men
gladly accepted this medical boon and subjected
themselves to this simple and painless operation.
But there were others who objected, sometimes
through fear of the pain, and sometimes
through what they termed "conscientious objections."
Anti-Inoculation Societies got busy
and spread their wretched literature throughout
the camps and made men thoroughly afraid,
both of the operation and of its results. To
meet this the War Office issued through the
papers and by pamphlets, information from the
medical authorities as to the wonderful results
that had already been achieved. They were
able to prove beyond all dispute, that of the men
who caught the infection in France, practically
all of those who had been inoculated recovered&mdash;their
cases being light&mdash;while those who had
not been inoculated became easy victims to the
disease. As the war has progressed these figures
have been amplified till now there can be
no question that the use of "Inoculation" has
made this dread disease a thing to be feared
less than the measles.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Officers adopted different methods in counteracting
the teaching of those who tried to keep
the soldiers from submitting. Some of them
argued with the men and told them of the wonderful
results that had been achieved. Others
warned their men that they would be left behind
when the battalion went to France. For my
own part I adopted the method of sending for
the medical men whose business it was to administer
the "dose." When they were all prepared
I marched in my men from some light
fatigue work in which they had been engaged,
told them to take off their coats and roll up
their sleeves, and three at a time they appeared
before the waiting surgeons. The business was
over in no time. I marched them off to a place
where I could talk to them and then acquainted
them with the advantages of inoculation. The
announcement of forty-eight hours' freedom
from drill for the whole company to let their
arms limber up put the few that were disgruntled
into good spirits again, and I was able to
report to the O. C. that 100 per cent of my
men were willing to be inoculated&mdash;and had
been inoculated! So little did any of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
suffer from its effects that they readily lined
up in ten days time when they were to receive
the second dose. At intervals of two or three
months in France the operation was repeated
and I never had a single man on the sick list
from enteric!</p>

<p>Now, while inoculation is excellent and should
be insisted on in all armies, both for the sake
of the individual soldier and of those who associate
with him, every possible precaution
should be taken by the soldier even after this
has been done. All water for drinking should
be looked upon with suspicion. Never take any
chances for the sake of getting a hasty drink.
Many communities have water supplies that are
admirable and when military operations are carried
on there, the difficulties disappear. On the
other hand many places have the most abominable
water supply systems. Where we were
in France, the country was very flat, and consequently
the drainage poor. The buildings that
housed the human beings and the cattle and
pigs on the farms were as a rule all built around
a "midden" into which flowed all the refuse.
In many cases the family water supply, a well,
was dug within three feet of this cesspool, so
that the drainage from the latter was almost
sure to reach the former. This is "asking for"
enteric, and some men fell victims to it before
they could be made to realise the danger. The
best rule to follow, as we all soon learned, was
to get our drinking water exclusively from the
army water wagons, for there the water had
been treated and the danger lessened. At times
we could not get to the water carts and a certain
degree of risk had to be run.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 609px;">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Not only with water has the greatest care to
be taken, but also with food. Flies are notorious
carriers of disease, and consequently soldiers
must see to it that no food is left uncovered.
Nor should food ever be placed near
latrines or any place where there is decaying
matter.</p>

<p>With universal inoculation, and with a careful
following of these simple rules laid down,
the ancient scourge of the army loses much of
its terror. The task of combating it lies mainly
with the medical and sanitary staff, though the
common soldier must also play his part of carefulness.
Some men carried small sterilisers
with them. This practice is not to be recommended
for it is very difficult to keep these little
utensils clean, and then they themselves become
harmful. Tabloid sterilisers I have found to be
effective in an emergency.</p>

<p>Those who have followed the history of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
war will remember how the Serbian Army was
threatened with extinction through the deadly
disease called <span class="smcap">Typhus</span>. There is no doubt that
the army and most of the civil population would
have been wiped out had it not been for the
timely assistance that that brave little nation
received from medical men and women throughout
the world, notably America. Many of these
brave souls made the final great sacrifice in
their endeavour to stamp out this disease. Then
again its horrors have been more recently
brought to our notice through the revelations
of the conditions at Wittenberg Camp in Germany.
The story that Captain Vidal and Major
Priestly, Officers of the Royal Army Medical
Corps, had to tell of their living death in that
awful internment camp, brought home to the
British people and then to the world, the frightfulness
of that disease, as well as the inhumanity
of certain German medical officials. Fortunately,
typhus has been little known in Western
Europe, and it is possible that soldiers in this
country will never know its ravages. But all
the same it is as well to be prepared for it, and
to know the methods of preventing its outbreak.
It is a disease that is carried by flees and lice
and consequently the most that can be said in a
work of this kind is to recommend the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
pains in the removal of these creatures from
the body should they ever take up their residence
there. I refer the reader to the chapter
on "Vermin" for methods of combating
"Lice."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dysentery</span>, <span class="smcap">Enteritis</span>, and <span class="smcap">Colitis</span>. These
names are applied to various kinds and grades
of stomach troubles, between which it is difficult
for the common soldier to differentiate, and
which show themselves with most distressing
effects. They come, usually, from drinking bad
water or eating bad food. Even with the greatest
care that the Commissariat could take, there
were occasions when food unfit for human consumption
was served to the troops. In the
trenches it was not to be wondered at that we
were stricken with these diseases, for the flies
that infested the trenches and lived on the dead
bodies there, favoured us with many visits at
food time and poisoned the latter for us. There
is no way that I know of to prevent it, and the
sufferer will be well advised to report to the
medical officer for skilled treatment. Cases of
dysentery were not very frequent in France,
but they were in Gallipoli where the food supply
left much to be desired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tetanus</span> is a disease that is brought about by
infection which enters the system through a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
wound. In the early part of the war it occurred
only too frequently till, in this case also, the
skill of the medical profession provided us with
a serum to combat it. The universal practice
now is to inoculate with anti-tetanic serum just
as soon as possible after a wound has been received.
By this means tetanus, like enteric, is
rapidly ceasing to be regarded as a menace.</p>

<p>I have no intention of exhausting the whole
category of diseases to which man&mdash;and therefore
the soldier&mdash;is heir, but simply to touch
upon those that are most likely to occur in a
campaign. The foregoing list includes, I believe,
all the most likely, but to them I should
like to add these two&mdash;<span class="smcap">Smallpox</span> and <span class="smcap">Cholera</span>.
To deal first with smallpox, we can say, fortunately,
that it is rare. This is due in large
part to the almost universal provision of vaccination,
which should be insisted upon in an
army. Cholera is of rare occurrence, and nothing
can be done to ward it off except to follow
carefully the ordinary rules of health and sanitation.
Should it, unfortunately, break out, the
army must place itself unreservedly in the
hands of medical authorities who are especially
qualified to deal with it.</p>

<p>There is one other disease that has made its
effects felt on almost every army, and which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
has been found impossible to thoroughly eliminate.
The hands of those who would lessen its
influence are to a great extent tied, because in
the past, the only method that has been permissible
to eliminate venereal disease has been
what I shall call "the Moral method"&mdash;the appeal
to morality and the intelligence of the individual
soldier. We have used this excellent
and praiseworthy method for generations, but
it has never been found capable of eradicating
the evil. Some other means, from an army
point of view, has obviously to be resorted to.
But even to discuss the matter, one runs the risk
of being ruled out of court by those who will
admit none but the aforementioned "moral argument."</p>

<p>When the first Expeditionary Force went to
France, the late Lord Kitchener, then Secretary
of State for War, issued an appeal to the men,
in which he besought them to be on their guard
against two of the evils that lessen the efficiency
of soldiers&mdash;wine and women. The men who
fell victims to wine or whiskey or other forms
of alcoholic intemperance, were punished, first
of all with imprisonment, and then, when it was
seen that this penalty did not meet the case, the
death penalty was imposed for such as became
intoxicated when at their post of duty. Obviously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the army cannot afford to have as its
guardians men who cannot keep sober. Those
who fell victims to loose women and contracted
venereal diseases&mdash;and it is beyond a doubt that
most of the women who follow an army are diseased&mdash;had
to be withdrawn from their positions
and sent back to the bases to hospitals.
Every man, therefore, who violated Lord Kitchener's
advice, was playing into the hands of the
enemy to this extent that he was taking the risk
of contracting a disease which would rob the
army of his services. My own Colonel used not
to mince words on this subject but used to say
that such men might just as well go over to the
enemy at once. But with every kind of pleading
and threat on the part of officers, it was found
that there were men who disregarded their advice.
A soldier's pay automatically stops under
these circumstances, and at first it was the custom
to acquaint his family with the fact that he
had been sent to such and such a hospital, and
the people of England soon got to know the
purpose of these hospitals, and many a home
suffered shame from the indiscretions of the
men who represented them in France. When
the Australian troops were quartered near
Cairo&mdash;than which there are few more immoral
cities in the world&mdash;venereal cases were frequent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
in spite of the admonitions of the combatant
officers and of the medical staff. What
was to be done? Every effort was made to restrain
the men and keep them out of the notorious
red light district, but case after case of the
disease turned up. Eventually some of the medical
men hit upon the scheme of establishing
at the entrance to the various camps, tents to
which men could go on their return from the
city. In those tents there was a representative
of the Army Medical Corps equipped with all
the latest appliances in the form of prophylactics,
and these were administered without
charge and without question, even as to name,
to all who sought this method of protecting
themselves after acts of indiscretion. The result
was very gratifying from the medical
standpoint, for the number of those who contracted
the disease rapidly declined and the
efficiency of the army was maintained at a correspondingly
high standard. Of course a protest
was immediately entered by those who were
particularly interested in the morals of the men,
and the charge was made that it was putting a
premium on immorality. For my own part, interested
in both of these matters, I have come to
the conclusion that the old methods have failed,
and that I would rather have an army immoral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and well than an army immoral and diseased.
As human nature is constituted at present I can
see no alternative, though I believe it to be our
bounden duty to continue to urge the need of
self-restraint. I do not fear that these words
will be taken to cast a slur upon any army, for
those of us who are not blind are perfectly
aware that the same kind of immorality exists
among civilian populations as in armies. For
those men who shall read these words of mine
I would with all the force at my command urge
the close following of the precepts of Lord
Kitchener.</p>

<p>A kindred problem with which the authorities
sometimes have to deal is that of "unnatural
men." Records of the German Army before
the war contained many examples of this most
revolting form of perversion. In the British
Armies that were raised at the outbreak of the
war, several cases occurred, the offenders being
punished with terms of imprisonment varying
from seven to fifteen years with hard labour&mdash;much
too lenient.</p>

<p>The whole problem is most difficult to deal
with, and any one who attempts to deal with it
risks public censure. Yet the problem must be
faced, nevertheless, and the sooner we apply
sane methods to its solution, the better. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
course views will differ as to what constitutes
sane methods, but I am convinced from my own
experience with soldiers that the method outlined
above is a good one. We must not, however,
fail to emphasise the dangers that men
run. They must be taught the folly of it. We
must make it plain to them that it is not worth
the candle to run the risk of contracting the
most horrible diseases that even our advanced
medical science can never cure with certainty,
for the sake of a brief gratification. A man's
whole life may be ruined; his innocent children
afflicted with a loathsome disease; his wife made
to endure years of physical and mental torment
as the price of that foolish act. Were this book
a moral treatise I should spend time in driving
this point home with more force. But as the
object I desire to achieve is to show men how
they can become soldiers and remain fit, it must
suffice to say again that the surest way to lay
up misery for yourself, to render yourself unfit
to remain at your soldier tasks and thus increase
the odds of the enemy against your side
is to run the risk of venereal disease through
contact with women.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
VERMIN</h2>


<p>I feel that no hints on health would be complete
without some brief reference to the
"terrors of the trenches"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lice</span>. A
learned Professor of one of the Universities of
England published a little book whose exact
title I have forgotten but which was something
like this&mdash;"Flees, Lice and Bugs, or, the Little
Brothers of the Prussian." That is pretty hard
on the enemy&mdash;or the lice&mdash;but it serves to emphasise
one important point and that is, that
the ravages of these vermin is so great that they
can well be said to be fighting the same cause as
the enemy. In spite of all a soldier can do, lice
are sure, sooner or later, to overtake him. They
make their nests in the straw upon which he
throws himself when fatigued, or in the walls
of houses, or on other human beings, and contact
is almost sure to bring them. They are
most interesting little pets whose sole interest
in life seems to be to lay eggs and thus make
sure that their race shall be perpetuated. The
female louse takes up her abode upon the soldier's
body and immediately sets herself to an
egg laying competition. If she gets five minutes
start of her victim she lays up for him
weeks of trouble, and the only thing to do is to
go after her and her eggs as soon as her presence
is made known. I discovered my first
louse while I was at luncheon in the trenches.
I seized the spot on my arm where I believed
her to be, and calling to my orderly hurried off
to the fields some distance behind the lines.
There we began the hunt which ended, I am
happy to be able to say, in her decease. But the
eggs had been laid and not for weeks did I succeed
in ridding myself of these unwelcome
boarders. I was, much against my will, used
as a perambulating incubator, and only the
greatest vigilance served to rid me of the pests.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 610px;">
<img src="images/p046ai.jpg" width="610" height="900" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FIGURE 12:<br />
Trench periscopes.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>It was our custom, as soon as we were relieved
from the trenches for a spell of a few
days, to turn all the men out into a field and
bid them "Hunt!" I used then to walk around
amongst the men and enquire of them what
luck they had had. "Two," "Seven," "Nineteen,"
etc., were the frequent replies. One of
the saddest men I have ever seen replied "None,
Sir." His unhappiness was due to the fact that
he was perfectly well aware that there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
some there to be caught, but that he had not yet
had the luck to get them.</p>

<p>As to means of combating them, the best is
constant vigilance. Make sure that not only
the live lice are killed but that the eggs as well
are destroyed, say with the ash of a lighted
cigarette. The next thing to remember is that
body lice are opposed to cleanliness, and that
the oftener you can wash yourself, the more
you inconvenience them. Gasoline squirted
over the body and the clothes also serves to discourage
them. Some thin cotton shirts covered
with a solution of carbolic, had a good effect,
and at the least they served as another barrier
to the little rascals before they could reach the
body.</p>

<p>Since I returned to this country, a manufacturer
of vermin killers told me that the following
method will be found effective: Take a
goose quill and seal up one end. Put in half
an inch of mercury, and then seal the other end
making a little phial of about an inch and a half
in length. Sew this to the clothes under each
armpit and round the belt line. As to whether
this will work I do not know, for I am glad to
be able to say that I have not needed to test the
theory since I returned to America.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fleas</span> are not so common, but when they occur,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
they must be hunted with the same vigilance
as lice, and the same methods apply to
their extermination. As carriers of typhus,
they are particularly to be dreaded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
HEALTH AND OFFICERS</h2>


<p>So far I have been dealing with disease from
the point of view of the individual and I
have said nothing of the duties of officers
towards their men in this respect. A word on
the subject may not be out of place.</p>

<p>When the new armies were formed in England
at the outbreak of war it was summer time
and the new troops were placed in tents in open
fields. The lessons of camp life were difficult
for many of these men to learn, and some of the
experience that was obtained was bought
dearly. It will occur to every soldier that the
greatest care must be paid to the cleanliness of
the lines. Men are often too lazy to carry their
scraps to the proper garbage pails, and carelessly
throw them around in the neighbourhood
of the tents. In fine weather they can be easily
seen and the culprits, when discovered, can be
made to clean up all the lines. When the culprits
cannot be discovered, whole companies
have to be put to this fatigue work. In wet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
weather it is worse, for the particles of meat
and bread get trodden into the ground and before
long there arises a stench from them.
Sometimes, too, rats and mice are encouraged
by this careless method. We used to find that
certain men who had an inherent objection to
fresh air, would eat all their meals within the
tents. This practice must be stopped at all
costs. Bring the men into the open and let
them stay there and they will be all the better
for it. It is excusable for them to remain in
the tents during rain but at no other time. The
inspecting officer would frequently find pieces of
bacon and butter and cheese trodden into the
ground on which the men had to sleep.</p>

<p>The lines <i>must</i> be kept clean. Officers will
be well advised to assign liberal fatigue work
to the men who are guilty of messing up the
lines, and littering them with particles of food,
papers, cigarette and cigar ends, etc. The regular
sanitary squad cannot be expected to do
its work unless the soldiers themselves are made
to co-operate. It is a good thing to encourage
the spirit of rivalry between units, and men can
often be jollied on into keeping their lines neat
and tidy by pointing out to them lines that are
better kept&mdash;and sometimes praising them when
their lines are up to the required standard. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
found that a good many of the men had quite an
artistic instinct, and would use up the old bottles
and stones from around the camp to execute
the most beautiful designs representing the
battalion colours or the flags of the allied nations.</p>

<p>We also met with considerable difficulty in
getting men to thoroughly air the tents. The
flaps of round tents should be rolled up just as
early as is possible each morning. A good plan
is to "strike" individual rows of tents occasionally
and give the ground a thorough airing
and disinfecting. We followed this plan with
tents which contained notoriously lazy men who
would not rise at the proper time and developed
the habit of leaving the flaps of the tents down.
They were awakened by the Orderly Corporal
in the usual course of events and given ten minutes
in which to appear outside their tents.
Promptly at the expiration of this time a squad
arrived on the scene and, undoing all their guy
ropes, let the tents down very suddenly on their
heads. It is very provoking to have a mass of
canvas come about your ears in this way, and
the slackers soon learned the only way to
avoid it.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>When an army has to live in tents, a certain
amount of dampness is almost certainly inevitable.
But if proper drains are dug around
them, and every advantage taken of the sunlight,
much can be done to avoid what frequently
ends in rheumatism or pneumonia.
It pays to construct good cinder roads in all the
camp lines and to see to it that the approaches
to the individual tents are prepared in the same
way. When we were first dumped down in a
field of clay in the Midlands of England and
told to prepare it for the horse lines to accommodate
the sixteen hundred horses that were
due in a few days, we were faced with a colossal
task. We were all turned into navvies, and long
before we even had shelter for the horses they
had arrived. It was a most tedious business
to construct lines for them in December in
England, and we had to cart many hundreds of
tons of cinders and rock to make the place possible.
For weeks we worked at it, and there
were complaints from the men that they had
not joined the army to be navvies. They had
joined it to fight, so they said. But when the
stables were finished and they could approach
the lines over nice smooth dry roads they realised
that their labour had not been in vain.
There is usually a fitting return in health from
all the labour invested in the preparation of a
good camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Another place in which officers and non-commissioned
officers must be on the alert for filth,
is the cook house. This is true in winter as well
as in summer time. It has been my experience
that the laziest and dirtiest men volunteer for
the task of cook. The reason is that they are
able to get the choicest portions for themselves,
be free from the bore of attending drills and
parades, and get a little higher pay, besides
what they can get from the soldiers on the side
for little favours. In an army such as was
formed in England at the beginning of the war
it was impossible to get enough trained cooks
for the work, and all sorts of men were run in
for the job. Many of them were thoroughly
lazy and incompetent. There was, of course, a
rooted objection to calling in the aid of women&mdash;though
few of us ever think of employing
men to do our cooking in private life&mdash;and when
we suggested it for the purpose of improving
the grade of our food in the Officers' Mess, we
were met with the reply that it had never been
done. That was the reason for keeping out a
good many reforms in Dear Old England. But
by strategy on our part, and by the eventual
demands of the stomachs concerned that some
change be made, we were able to introduce a
woman manager for the mess kitchen. She reformed
everything, including the costs of the
food. Our mess bills were considerably reduced,
the food was better cooked, and we got
a variety that had never seemed to occur to
the late robbers that we had employed. When
England began to feel the want of fighting men,
it entered the brains of some of the Brass Hat
officials that this was a sphere in which the
women could well supplant the men&mdash;and
woman came into her own again, at least in
part. That was a job that women <i>could</i> do well,
but it was a long time before we would agree to
let them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 620px;">
<img src="images/p054ai.jpg" width="620" height="900" alt="" />
<div class="caption">FIGURE 15:<br />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>But whether men or women are in charge of
this important department of an army, the duty
will still devolve upon the officers to see that
the cookhouses are kept clean and that the food
is up to the proper standard. One case occurred
in a camp near London where they were
following the principle of allowing outside
caterers to supply the food, in which the Orderly
Officer of the day just managed to stop
in time, the service to the men of meat that was
diseased. The desire to make a little additional
profit had blinded these unpatriotic people
to the welfare of the troops, and they were
punished with a fine and with the loss of their
catering contract. That is mild punishment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Grafters of every kind, from those who put bad
powder into shells or bad leather into boots, to
those who risk an outbreak of sickness through
supplying improper food, should all be treated
the same way that certain other enemies of their
country are treated&mdash;a Court-martial and a firing
party. No condemnation is too severe for
them. Officers will not always find it an easy
task to detect these thieves, but they must be
very much on their job for this purpose.</p>

<p>Then again good food sometimes is allowed
to become bad food through the careless handling
by the cooks and their assistants. Covers
are left off dishes that contain meat, butter,
cheese, etc., and they are ruined by dust or
flies. Contaminated food is allowed to remain
in close proximity to the food that is to be offered
to the troops; cooks either use unclean
utensils themselves or allow the orderlies from
the various units to return dirty utensils to
them; or they handle the refuse and then the
food without ever a thought to washing their
hands. One very knowing old rascal of a cook
we had used to have his place in excellent condition
at eleven in the morning when the Orderly
Officer used to make his rounds, and one
day when I came upon him suddenly it was to
find that he was using one of the bread bags as
a receptacle for his change of clothes&mdash;a filthy
collection of shirts, socks, etc. He was fired,
and cursed me for many a day as he carried his
great weight of avoirdupois round the training
field with a rifle over his shoulder like any other
infantryman.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">

<div class="caption">FIGURE 16:<br />

and horses in the gas zone were equipped as shown.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>With regard to water, while the regular line
officers must also keep an eye to its general
purity, it is generally left to the care of the
medical staff to test it from time to time to make
certain of its fitness for human use. We experienced
a good deal of trouble in making the
men keep their wash lines clean and in making
them refrain from throwing soapy, greasy water
on the ground. It is the easiest method&mdash;for
them&mdash;but the costliest in the long run, and
they must be made to throw it into the proper
drains.</p>

<p>Then, too, no camp will be complete without
a thorough system of garbage disposal. The
refuse should be collected into tins that can be
closed to keep away the rats, etc., and then
taken at certain specified times to the incinerator.
The latter can easily be built under any
circumstances and there can be no reason for a
camp not being well supplied in this matter.</p>

<p>Latrines, also, must be thoroughly inspected
by the officers of every unit. They should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
established at some distance from the tent lines,
and as far removed as possible from the kitchen.
Sand and lime should be liberally supplied. The
tasks of attending the latrines will normally
fall to the sanitary squad who can be assisted
by those who are convicted of the crime of failing
to keep their lines clean. It is wonderful
what a wholesome effect on a lazy man has the
imposition of three days latrine duty! In the
trenches this was one of the few punishments at
our disposal for the slackers, for they welcomed
any punishment that would send them away out
of the firing line.</p>

<p>The same principles that have been laid down
for tent life will apply more or less to life in
billets. When the winter came all the troops
in England and Scotland were moved into billets
in towns where they could be accommodated.
These were usually manufacturing
towns that had numerous small homes that
could each accommodate a soldier or two. From
the point of view of training this is a system far
from satisfactory for the men so easily get out
of control. But it is the best system that we
had at the time. Later on, extensive villages
of huts were constructed, and the training proceeded
normally.</p>

<p>Sometimes groups of men were assembled in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
large vacant houses. There was no furniture
in them and the troops had to sleep on the floor.
Cooking facilities were inadequate, but worst
of all were the toilet facilities. These houses
had been constructed to serve as the homes for
average families of five to ten, and when fifty
or sixty men were turned into them the result
is imaginable. The same problems will probably
be presented if ever American soldiers are
housed in this way, and those who happen to be
officers will have to exercise the greatest vigilance.</p>

<p>Then again we found that there are some men
who have no idea of the risk they run in leaving
food lying about a house or hidden away. After
a certain group had moved away from Bedford,
England, it was my business to go round the
houses they had occupied to see if they were fit
for occupation by the incoming troops. I found
to my horror in one of the houses that some of
the men, instead of taking surplus meat out to
the garbage cans, had put it under a board in
the floor! It had been there a few days when
I found it, and examination of the other rooms
disclosed the fact that all sorts of things from
meat and bread and tins to old clothes had
been hidden in similar places by these lazy fellows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>My reader will soon realise that the officer of
to-day has to keep his eyes constantly open to
preserve the best conditions for the training of
his men. And while I am on this point I would
just add this word. Not only must the officers
see to it that the food and water are good
and the camp kept clean, but he must also have
the men's health constantly in mind when he is
planning their schedule of training. Moderation
is the word. It is possible to be too enthusiastic
and do the men more harm than good
with hasty training. Exercises should be graduated.
It must be remembered that many of the
men who will constitute civilian armies are not
used to out-of-door life and their training must
be gentle. It is not fair for an officer to expect
his men to be able to march twelve or twenty
miles on a hike while he rides comfortably with
them on a horse! It is a good thing for him to
share the fatigue of his men that he may be the
better able to direct their training. I have
found that a good many of these hikes were
planned by the higher officers who never walked
and never understood when men began to fall
out from fatigue. Rests during marching
should be fairly frequent and the men should
be taught the advantages to be gained by loosening
their packs and throwing themselves down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
flat on the ground to relax all their muscles.
Singing and whistling should be encouraged on
the march, for there is nothing like it to make
a long road seem short, but smoking should be
reserved for the rest periods.</p>

<p>The principle of "plenty of rests" should
also be followed during physical exercises and
a man should never be asked to hold his arm
long in any uncomfortable position. A thoughtful
officer is soon rewarded by the increased
efficiency of his men. "Do unto others as you
would have them do unto you"&mdash;will bring big
returns in the army.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
COVER AND TRENCHES</h2>


<p>This war is being fought out, not in great
open battles, but in successive conflicts
from the security of trenches in what
"Papa Joffre" has called the "nibbling process."
It is not simple work but such as calls
for healthy bodies, trained minds, and steady
nerves. Quick action is often necessary. Independence
of thought, ingenuity and personal
courage, combined with implicit obedience,
make up the ideal soldier.</p>

<p>The training through which a civilian must
go, then, will be such as to develop these qualities.
Every syllabus of training must be drawn
up with this in view, and all the time the attention
of the officers must be kept on the fact that
the training must be such as to make soldiers
who will be efficient in the kind of war that is
being waged. Much that has been written in the
text books for armies has had to be discarded
as out of date. It is no exaggeration to say that
the British knew very little about modern warfare
when we went to France, in spite of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
fact that we had, during this century, waged a
war in South Africa, not to mention the numerous
border engagements in India. We did not
know the tremendously important part that artillery
was to play; we knew practically nothing
of the use of bombs; we had never made gas and
did not know its constitution; and in the work
of trench construction we were in the kindergarten
class. Our enemy taught us many of
these things and we learned them slowly. Now
we have reached his standard and gone past him
as the Tanks testify. But in pure frightfulness
we can never compete with him and never intend
to.</p>

<p>Eight hours a day of hard but varied training
was our rule with frequent evening lectures.
Conditions were arranged as much like those on
active service as possible, even to the use of
"live" bombs. Men are very reluctant at first
to handle these explosive little instruments of
war, and they must be given confidence in themselves
long before they reach the firing line.
There they are used as freely as a mechanic
uses a machine.</p>

<p>It is said that one general who was training
his men in the Midlands of England had a difficulty
in getting them to keep their heads down.
They could not see the necessity for it and always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
wanted to see all that was going on. Now
in actual warfare the individual soldier is able
to see very little of what is transpiring round
about him, and he has to be content to come
through with a whole head. Accordingly the
General served out to a few trustworthy men a
number of live, ball cartridges. During the
man&oelig;vres the men who would put their heads
up heard some of these missiles singing round
their ears, and soon learned that it was unwise
to be too curious. I am not sure that I would
recommend this method&mdash;for were an accident
to happen it would bring disgrace and dismissal
to the officer who had employed it&mdash;but it is
certainly an effective means.</p>

<p>One of the first things to be insisted upon in
training a man is that he learn the use of <span class="smcap">Cover</span>.
He must learn not only that cover is necessary,
but also what constitutes effective cover of various
materials. The most common form of cover
is that afforded by piled up earth. A rifle bullet
fired at short range will pierce about forty
inches of earth so that nothing less than
thirty-six inches can be considered as giving
protection from ordinary bullets. Where sand
can be obtained ten inches less will suffice.
Ordinary turf is not nearly so good and nothing
less than five feet in thickness is sufficient.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Bricks are effective. If they are placed end
on giving a thickness of nine inches this will
be found sufficient so that a man can feel fairly
secure from rifle bullets standing behind an
ordinary brick wall. Where wood is used much
depends on its degree of hardness; thirty inches
for hardwood and forty-five for softwood can
be taken as affording complete protection. Any
of the harder substances such as iron and steel,
etc., are preferable, but they can seldom be obtained.
Of ordinary iron plate three-fourths
inch is necessary and less for the different varieties
of steel. Usually several of these media
must be used. Boards can be arranged with
stones and sand or litter, etc., between them.
The point to be remembered is that the required
thickness must be obtained, not at the base of
the cover but at the top, to support which a
much larger base will usually be required.</p>

<p>When a man has learnt what thickness of materials
he needs to have to protect his life, it will
be a good thing to take him out and let him see
how far bullets are able to pierce these media
by actually firing at them from point blank
range. That will give him a respect for bullets
and impress the lesson on him.</p>

<p>But he must also be told that cover that protects
is only half what is required. It must be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
such as to allow him to become offensive while
giving him defence. The problem is a simple
one in actual trenches, where he has no alternative
but to build them continuously and then
fire over the top or through loopholes of steel.
But when more open fighting develops he must
learn that his business is not only to get reasonable
protection for his own body but to be able
to bring his rifle to bear on the enemy. This
necessitates a certain amount of exposure.
Certain devices have been developed during this
war to allow a man to fire his rifle from beneath
the parapet of the trench by means of specially
adapted periscopes. These are of great use for
snipers but cannot be used by all the men.</p>

<p>In open fighting men often make the mistake
of seeking cover in what is obviously the most
protected place from rifle bullets, but equally
obvious to those of experience as the most likely
place for the enemy to choose as marks for his
artillery. Orchards, woods, houses, etc., come
within this category, and it is only experience
that will teach a man what places to choose and
what places to avoid. Wherever the enemy can
view the approaches to these shelters, either by
direct vision from their positions or by means
of aeroplanes or observation balloons, they become
dangerous as cover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Modern trenches are intended to give cover
from fire and from view. They are seldom
roofed over, so that, as a matter of fact, they
can be seen from the air, but it is not by any
means an easy task either for an aeroplane to
drop bombs there (a ditch three feet wide) nor
yet for the artillery to hit them. But we seldom
are able to inherit trenches&mdash;they usually have
to be dug under cover of darkness while the
enemy is sniping. For this purpose each man
in the British army carries a small entrenching
tool on his back, as well as two sandbags.
Every man is trained in the use of this valuable
little tool, and soon learns never to be without
it. When, during an advance, he needs to provide
cover for himself, he throws himself down
on the ground placing his rifle at his left side,
and begins to dig away the earth at his right
side, throwing the loose earth up in front of
him. Just as soon as he can he takes the sandbags
from his back and fills them, placing them
in front of him. Under this imperfect cover he
proceeds to deepen the hole till he can roll his
body into it. This miniature trench should be
two feet wide and three feet long. Then if time
permits he should add small comforts such as a
recess for his feet, drainage for water, etc. He
will find that he needs to dig down to about two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
feet, all the time throwing the earth out in
front and occasionally pushing it out a little so
as to make it of sufficient width, for, of course,
he will be seeking to get a parapet of about a
yard in thickness at the top. If he has an opportunity
of firing he should do so, not over the
top of his cover but round the right side of it.
To fire over it is to ask for trouble. The body
and legs should be placed in such a position that
they are covered as much as possible by the
earth thrown up in front.</p>

<p>If an advance has to be made from this position,
the small trench will have served its purpose
in giving temporary shelter. But there
are times when troops have to consolidate positions
won in this way, and on the site of these
primitive trenches, more elaborate ones have to
be made. At the battle of Neuve Chapelle the
troops took up a certain line, dug themselves
in in a rough way, and then during the night
they set to work to construct the very trenches
that still shelter them to this day. But it was
due to the entrenching tools and the few sand
bags that they were able to hold the line during
the hours of daylight, and when the next morning
dawned they had a fairly adequate protection.</p>

<p>While the question of cover is very important,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
I do not wish to convey the impression that men
should have this subject always in their minds.
To use a rock or a tree or a mound of earth as a
temporary shelter is one thing; but to continue
to hide behind it at the time an advance is
needed, is another. The man who hesitates to
go forward when he has recovered his wind, but
who takes care of his precious skin by remaining
under cover, is worse than useless. The object
of all troops must be to get into touch with
the enemy and drive him out with the bayonet.
Cover will help to keep a man alive for a little
while to be able to do that work.</p>

<p>When through adverse circumstances&mdash;usually
the presence of the enemy in superior force&mdash;an
army has to go to ground, it sets to work
in dead earnest to build its trenches. We have
learned that the best fortifications that can be
got are those that are constructed in the earth.
The guns of Verdun have practically never been
in operation&mdash;indeed at the present time there
are no guns in the old forts&mdash;and the reason for
this is that earth works of such strength were
thrown up at a distance from the forts that the
Germans were never able to get their heavy
guns to bear on them. The forts of Liége, and
Namur, and Antwerp all fell before the great
howitzers, but the earth works of Verdun were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
too much for them. It is doubtful if large forts
will ever again be used in inland places, for the
earthworks have proved their great superiority.</p>

<p>Trenches are laid out and dug as shown in the
accompanying diagram [<a href="#figure4">Figure 4</a>]. They do not
consist of one long straight line, but what may be
described as a succession of little rooms, about
twenty feet long, seven feet deep and three feet
broad. They are seldom roofed over. Each
little room is connected to the ones on either
side by a trench that runs behind the four-feet-square
traverse that is of solid earth and
which serves the purpose of localising the effect
of shells, bombs, etc. If the trenches were in
one straight line, a shell that fell there would
be liable to injure a great many men; whereas
under the present system the traverse acts as
a buffer and limits the radius of its explosive
force. The trench itself is dug about three feet
deep, care being taken to lift off the top layer
of grass and keep it aside to place over the
front of the earth on completion of the trenches,
to render them less visible. As the earth is
lifted out it is thrown to the front and rear, and
some of it put into sandbags which are then
laid like stones as shown. The front part of the
trench is then called the parapet and the rear
part the parados. Both must be made strong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
the parapet for reasons already given, and the
parados in order to protect the men from the
force of shells that fall just behind the trenches.
About a foot from the ground there is placed a
board that is called the "firing step," on which
the men stand when they are about to fire. I
have said that there is seldom any roof over the
trenches. It is difficult to cover in the trenches
because of the limited supply of materials.
Then again it is questionable if roofing pays;
for, admitting that they may be able to keep
out small bombs and rifle bullets, they can never
hope to be able to keep out shells. The Germans
used to roof in a great deal&mdash;but then
they were there to wage a defensive war and did
not propose to move for a good while.</p>

<p>In some ground the earth will "hold itself
up" at the sides of the trenches, in other ground
it will have to be revetted. This is done with
chicken wire, or with willows or old staves
where they can be had. It is important to have
the sides firm, or else in wet weather especially,
they will prove a nuisance to the occupants of
the trenches.</p>

<p>Some kind of floor should be provided for the
trenches. The simplest and best are made in
the following way: Take two seven-inch boards
about ten feet in length, nail them together to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
make a fourteen-inch plank, and then cover the
whole with fairly fine chicken wire. Place these
boards on the ground with the side on which
the wires are joined downwards. They keep
the feet from slipping, are easily cleaned by
being upended when they are dry, and allow the
space under them to be reached easily to pick
up scraps of food, etc. There is nothing more
heart breaking than having to pursue your
weary course for miles, sometimes, up trenches
with slippery sides and sloping, wet, treacherous
bottoms.</p>

<p>In each trench there must be dugouts for the
men to sleep in. The first ones that are made
will be very primitive, and will be very much
like a fireplace in a room&mdash;simply excavations in
the back wall of the trench almost on a level with
the bottom of it. At first they used to be dug
in the front of the trench, but this practice was
discontinued as it was found to weaken the
power of resistance of the very important parapet.
In the course of time more labour can be
expended upon the dugouts, and it will be found
advisable to construct them of uniform size, six
feet long by four feet wide by four feet high.
By having them uniform we give the engineers
a chance to make frames that can be used to
support the roof and the sides and bring them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
well from the rear to construct the dugouts.
These dimensions do not make a very commodious
home for four men, but never more
than three of a section (of four) are off duty
at the same time, and besides there is considerable
danger in having large dugouts, as they
present a correspondingly larger target for the
guns. A direct hit on a large dugout will often
bring the whole thing crashing about the ears of
the inhabitants. My own adjutant and one of
my brother officers were killed by falling beams
in large dugouts. The entrance to the dugouts
must be kept as small as possible so as to protect
the occupants from shells that fall just
outside.</p>

<p>The Germans used to follow the custom of
digging many of their "funk holes," as they
were called, many feet underground. Sometimes
they went down twenty and even thirty
feet. The idea of this was that they could retreat
into these secure places during a bombardment
and then emerge with their machine guns
as soon as the attacking infantry had started to
approach over "No Man's Land." We never
followed that custom, for while it will work at
times, yet the attacking infantry may be upon
you before you are aware of it and have you at
their mercy with bayonets and bombs from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
parapet. This the Germans have learnt to
their cost many times on the Somme.</p>

<p>Many efforts have been made to construct
dugouts, reasonably near the surface, that
would be shell proof. This is a most difficult
matter. It is easy enough to make them shrapnel-proof.
A layer of galvanised iron on the
roof covered with a foot of loose earth will accomplish
this for the velocity of shrapnel is not
great. But with high explosive shells it is different.
It was seen at Liége and Namur what
terrific effects high explosive shells fired from
howitzers could have even on re-enforced concrete.
I am told that at Port Arthur, a Russian
General was killed in a shelter that was covered
with over twelve feet of concrete. The closest
we can approach to a shell-proof dugout on the
field is as follows: Dig an approach trench
about ten feet deep, leading into a hole of this
depth, by any dimensions you may choose&mdash;say
six feet square. Put in supports for the roof
that shall be four feet from the floor. Roof in
with steel rails, such as are used on railroads,
then cover them with two or three layers of
bricks that have been broken into small pieces.
Leave a five-foot air space and then place an
exactly similar roof above and cover the whole
with earth. Small shells will be stopped at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
first set of rails, while large ones may possibly
pierce them. But the effect of the explosion
will mostly be taken up in the airchamber and
the dugout itself protected. The reader will
readily perceive the difficulty of constructing
such dugout on the field and they can certainly
not be provided for the accommodation of the
common soldier however precious his life
may be.</p>

<p>As the days go by, every effort must be made
to improve the trenches. This can be done in
many ways, some of which will be obvious. The
front line is, of course, the most important one,
and the greatest amount of work has to be done
there. But support and reserve lines as well
must be constructed and many communicating
trenches. Support lines were usually dug at a
distance of thirty to eighty yards from the firing
line. In them we kept a few men to be used
in case of emergency. This line was an exact
duplicate of the front line and was intended to
be used in case we were pushed back. The reserve
line was about five to eight hundred yards
back from the front line and was not brought to
any very great degree of completion. Interspersed
between these three lines were many
redoubts, or especially strong points containing
machine guns, etc., whose defenders were expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
to hold on to the very last and take advantage
of their more secure position to make
the attacker pay dearly for his advance. All
these lines had to be linked up by communicating
trenches, which started about a mile in the
rear of the front line and went up in zigzag
lines to the latter position, crossing the other
trenches on their way. These communicating
trenches are used for the purpose of bringing
up troops and supplies, etc., and for taking to
the rear the men that have been wounded. It is
usually arranged to have some of these trenches
"Up" and some of them "Down" roads. Each
line of trenches (except of course the "communicating")
contain dugouts for the use of
the troops that hold them. The distance between
the communicating trenches varies from
twenty-five yards to three or four hundred according
to the state of perfection of the trench
system.</p>

<p>For special weapons such as machine guns
and bomb guns, special shelters have to be
made. Extra strong parapets are provided as
well as head cover of railroad ties, and every
effort is made to keep the exact position of the
machine guns secret from the enemy. We soon
learnt that he was very anxious to find our machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
guns and would shell us liberally in the
hope of being able to locate them.</p>

<p>Care must be given to the question of drainage.
Small ditches should be dug at intervals
of a few yards to lead the water to pits in the
rear. In Flanders, where we were very near
river level, we installed hand and power pumps
to keep the water from taking possession of
the trenches. Even then, on rainy days we
sometimes were in water up to our waists.</p>

<p>Great care must also be taken in the construction
of latrines. The method that was followed
was to dig a short "blind alley" trench at right
angles to one of the communicating trenches,
and at a distance of twelve or fifteen yards from
the front line. Starting from the end of this
blind alley, the trench was gradually filled in
with earth as it was used. In other cases biscuit
tins were used as receptacles and the ordinary
sanitary squads emptied them at specified
times into a fairly deep pit. These latrines
should be well protected with sandbags to keep
the enemy from finding them and training a machine
gun on them, in the knowledge that they
were very likely to get some of the men who
used them during the day.</p>

<p>This, I believe, gives the principal points in
the construction of the trenches. Men should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
be taught to dig them in broad daylight at first
and then when they have learnt the knack, they
should be set to dig them at night. From time
to time during their training they should be
made to return&mdash;preferably to the same sections
of the trenches&mdash;to improve them and maintain
them. An excellent scheme is to arrange competitions
among the men to spur them on to invent
ingenious devices for protecting themselves
and their fellows during their occupation
of them. At certain times they should also be
made to spend a night and then several nights
there, going through the regular routine of sentry
duty, stand to arms, etc., just as they will
have to do in real warfare. Another scheme is
to choose opposing sides with trenches within
easy reach, say, twenty-five yards apart. Arrange
a three-day tour of the trenches, and let
each side attempt to surprise the other. Umpires
can be stationed in No Man's Land to
decide as to the relative merits of the two sides.
At certain times, additional interest can be
given to the conflict by some harmless missiles
such as sand bags (without the sand!) rolled up
and made into a ball the size of a base ball with
string. These will also give excellent practice
in bomb throwing.</p>

<p>The rules of the trenches can be summed up
in a few words: "Keep your spirits up and
your head down."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
PROTECTION OF TRENCHES</h2>


<p>There are two things to be done after the
trenches have been dug&mdash;one is to keep
them in order, and the other is to provide
outside protection for them. The elements
themselves are enough to play havoc with the
sand bags and the walls of trenches, but if you
add to this the fact that they will immediately
become the marks for the enemy gunners you
will see that the cost of upkeep is liable to be
high.</p>

<p>During the first year of the war the Germans
were supplied with an amount of shells that
enabled them to do what they pleased with our
trenches without our being able to reply. Indeed,
for many months, as is now well known, we
were on an allowance of six shells per battery
per day, or about one shell per gun per day!
Gunners will readily appreciate the uselessness
of a stock of this kind. The result of this discrepancy
in the number of shells was that the
enemy could shell us with impunity. He used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to set to work to break down our parapets early
in the morning, and then, knowing that we
should have to repair them during the night,
would train machine guns on the breeches that
had been made. It is a very disheartening
business to have the parapets that you have
laboured so hard to construct, knocked down in
a few minutes. There would be some consolation
in being able to serve him the same way,
but that was denied us at that time. Indeed,
one of the best ways to preserve your trenches
is to let him know by experience that every time
he breaks them down, you will do the same thing
to him.</p>

<p>Every night there will be something to do in
this connection. No effort must be spared to
get the trenches into first-class condition and
keep them thus. It is very annoying to relieve
a battalion that has lain down on their job during
their tour of duty in the line, and to find
that you have a great deal of work to do&mdash;work
that could have been avoided if they had taken
reasonable care of the work that had already
been accomplished when they took over the
trenches.</p>

<p>As to the outside protection for the trenches,
that consists for the most part of barbed wire.
Sir Ian Hamilton, in his report on the Dardanelles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Expedition, paid a tribute to the effectiveness
of the Turkish barbed wire. It was the
means of stopping a British advance more than
once on the Peninsula, just as it was in France.
At the battle of Aubers Ridge, fought on May
9, 1915, we suffered most heavily from the fact
that the wires had not been cut, and therefore
we were unable to make progress. We had to
retreat, leaving a number of our dead and
wounded before the enemy lines. It would be
difficult to exaggerate the part that barbed
wires have played in this war. Wherever they
are set up it means that a thorough bombardment
must be made before an advance can be
risked.</p>

<p>The erection of these entanglements is really
the work of Engineers, but so extensive is the
task that infantrymen have to be called in to
do the pick and shovel work while the engineers
do the directing. Stakes are driven deep into
the ground, and round them the wire is twisted
as it is taken from stake to stake. Some wires
are laid on a level with the ground, some a few
inches above it, then all the way up to ten or
fifteen feet into the air, making a regular network.
We tried to have our wires extending
over a width of ground of at least twenty feet.</p>

<p>But not only are barbed wires used, but also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
electrically charged wires in some cases, though
between the lines they will seldom be of much
use for a single shell may short circuit the
system and it be rendered harmless. An effective
method was that of placing trip wires
near the ground, and then a little beyond them
bayonets with the sharp points uppermost, or
pointed sticks, so that when the man tripped
over the wire he would fall and impale himself
on the spikes. Sometimes bombs were attached
to the wires in places where it was thought
likely that the enemy would attempt to cut them
or come through them.</p>

<p>As these entanglements have to be erected
during the night and under the fire of the enemy
it will be seen that it becomes exceedingly dangerous
work. But it has to be done, and the
risk must be taken for the sake of the additional
security it will give to the trenches. It
has been suggested that this is work to which
the conscientious objectors in England&mdash;the
Pacifists here&mdash;might be put. It is necessary
work for the preservation of life, and is not
specifically military. It is labourer's work.
There is no chance of fighting out there nor of
taking human life. Then it offers an excellent
opportunity of winning the martyr's crown because
some one is sure to turn a machine gun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
on you if you remain out there long enough.
All of these points should appeal to Pacifists.
But the greatest reason from our point of view
is that it would save the lives of valuable men!</p>

<p>The men in the trenches are further protected
by men whose business it is to go out into No
Man's Land and remain there hours at a time,
lying in some kind of hole, and listening to be
able to detect the presence of the enemy.
Should the enemy make his appearance in small
parties, these listening posts can usually take
care of them, but when they are in large parties,
the listening post men return to the trenches
and give warning. The best nerves are needed
by the men who go out into the open to do this
work, and sooner or later every one has to take
a turn at it. These listening posts are sometimes
entirely disconnected from the trenches,
and out beyond their own barbed wire, through
which the men have to make a passage for the
time being, and of course keep it secret. But
sometimes they are connected with the fire
trench by a shallow trench or sap which is dug
out into the neutral territory whenever circumstances
are favourable.</p>

<p>When the troops landed at Suvla Bay, on the
Peninsula, they found several excellent water
holes that were most inviting to parched and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
thirsty men. A rush was made for them, when
suddenly a terrific explosion was heard, and
dozens of men fell flat on the ground, some dead,
some wounded. The Turks had taken the precaution
to place land mines round these wells,
and as soon as they were stepped upon, the
mines went off. This is a genuine ruse of war
and was used also between the lines. The Turks
never resorted to the treachery that General
Botha had to overcome in German East Africa
where he found the wells, not mined, but poisoned.
A recent report from France tells us
that in the present retreat the Germans are employing
the same dastardly tactics. It is one
thing to protect your trenches or your line of
retreat; it is quite another to take the lives of
men in this barbarous way.</p>

<p>Trenches dug in the foregoing manner and
protected by barbed wire will give the infantryman
a chance to live. But he will increase or
decrease the probability of coming out alive according
as he is careful or careless during the
time he is there. Nothing, of course, can save
the men if the enemy is determined to thoroughly
shell the line, and the orders are to hold
it. The sanest thing when a bombardment begins
is to withdraw to the next safe line. But
the enemy will sometimes be content to allow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
men to remain in their trenches for a while
without shelling them provided they do not wilfully
provoke him. A column of smoke arising
from the trenches where the men were cooking
was usually considered by the enemy as provocation,
and over the shells would come. This
brings us to the point that I wish to make regarding
fires. The men must eat during their
tour of duty, and they must have hot food, consequently
fires of some kind are needed. But
they should be made of very small pieces of
wood cut up with a pocket knife so small that
they will not give off any smoke. By following
this method a safe and very hot fire can be
made. At times we were supplied with small
quantities of charcoal which was very acceptable.
As a matter of fact, more liberties in this
connection can usually be taken in the firing
trench than in the support or reserve trenches.
The enemy knows perfectly well men are in the
firing trench. He sees from the rifle fire that
that is manned, but it is a good thing to keep
him guessing about the other trenches.</p>

<p>For the same reason there should never be
any unnecessary noise in the trenches. It provokes
the enemy to throw bombs and other unwelcome
missiles.</p>

<p>I have indicated that the present form of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
trenches, being in a continuous line, makes it
necessary either to construct loopholes or to
look over the top of the parapet in order to fire.
I have indicated too that there are several forms
of rifles that can be fired through periscopes,
but these must as yet be considered special and
are not for the ordinary man to use. No doubt
such a rifle will be invented and generally used
in the future. But in this war we soon learned
that it was "unhealthy" to put our heads above
the parapet any more frequently than we had
to. Therefore, in order to see what the enemy
was about, and to wait for sniping opportunities
we used periscopes. Some of those that
were brought to France were huge cumbersome
boxes that made a fine mark for the enemy's
sharpshooters. But the kind that was most
generally used after the first six months of the
war was that which consisted of a stick with two
slanting grooves in it, one near each end, into
which grooves small mirrors could be fitted.
We found them quite effective, and should an
accident happen and a mirror be broken they
were easily replaced from the store we carried
with us for that purpose. Not having a box of
any kind they were very difficult to see from the
enemy lines.</p>

<p>Certain gunners who used to come to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
trenches as Forward Observing Officers were
equipped with a splendid periscope that had
beautiful lenses in it. But it was very costly
and could not easily be repaired if once damaged.</p>

<p>To make the image in the periscope clearer,
binoculars can be applied to the lower glass at
the proper angle, and almost as clear a view
obtained as by looking over the parapet. One
disadvantage of the periscope is that it makes
the distance seem greater than it really is, and
many a man receives a shock when he places
his head above the parapet after looking
through a periscope for a while, to see how close
the enemy trenches are.</p>

<p>Trenches are exposed to attack not only from
the surface but also from the air and from beneath
the surface of the ground. Aeroplanes
come over and drop steel darts or bombs, and
only very strong head cover can give protection
against them. But it is very hard to hit a
trench from the air with a missile of this kind,
and the danger to the men in the trenches is not
very great. By far the greater danger comes
from mining. Men must be on the watch all
the time to detect these operations of the enemy
and to forestall them where possible. Special
instruments like giant stethoscopes have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
invented and men are told off to hold them to
the ground to detect the sounds of digging.
But, while these instruments are of use, the best
means is a well trained ear. If the enemy is discovered
mining towards your position, the only
thing to do is to countermine him and try and
blow him up before he is ready to touch off the
fuse that is intended for your destruction. It is
not an easy matter to decide just where the
countermine should be sunk or how far to go.
Many combats have been fought with pick and
shovel in the bowels of the earth in cases where
one side or the other has broken through the
gallery. But any risk must be taken rather
than let the enemy enjoy uninterrupted his
work of mining you.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
ARTILLERY FIRE</h2>


<p>It may be desirable to indicate the various
kinds of shell fire to which trench men are
exposed. (I pass over rifle fire which is
harmless so long as men keep their heads down
and avoid corners from which they can be enfiladed.)
No amount of caution will save a man
from shells if they happen to be falling in his
neighbourhood. The most frequent visitor of
the shell variety is of course the shell from the
field gun. The British use an 18-pounder, the
French a 75 millimetre, and the Germans a 77
millimetre&mdash;all shells of about the same calibre
(3 inches). Of these the best gun is undoubtedly
the French, which is a perfectly marvellous
piece of mechanism. But all of them are deadly
in their effects. They may fire either shrapnel
or high explosive&mdash;always spoken of in the
army as H. E. In the former case, the shell
that is fired contains a nose that comes off at
the time for which it is set, and liberates hundreds
of small round leaden bullets. These go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
out in cone shape and spray the ground round
about. Shrapnel is very effective against men
in the open but of little use when they are entrenched,
for very few of the bullets from any
shell will enter the ditch itself. When the British
army first took the field they had very little
H. E. Shrapnel had been used successfully
in South Africa, and it was thought it would
do in France. The proportions used were 96
per cent shrapnel to 4 per cent H. E. We learnt
our lessons dearly&mdash;as we usually do&mdash;and in
time we came to realise that for breaking down
parapets shrapnel was absolutely useless. The
proportion that is now used is about 90 per cent
H. E. to 10 per cent of shrapnel.</p>

<p>The soldiers used to call the 77 mill. shells
of the Germans "Pip-squeaks." They used to
give a "pip" and then a "squeak." If you
heard the first and did not hear the second you
were dead, while, if you heard them both you
could consider yourself still alive. Another familiar
name for them was that of "Cheeky
Charlies," from the fact that they had the habit
of coming in without being announced.</p>

<p>In addition to the field guns there are the
"Mediums" or guns of about 5 inches calibre.
The familiar name for the German shell fired
from them was "the Crump"&mdash;by reason of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
fact that they sat down alongside you with a
terrific "Crump" as their greeting. As in the
former case, those who could report having
heard the "Crump" were still alive.</p>

<p>Then there are various long range guns between
five and nine inches in calibre. But long
range guns do not play the part that high-angle
or Howitzer guns do. The Germans wasted a
good many shells in firing at targets even as
far away as twenty-three miles, but nowadays
shells are usually kept for targets that there is
a fair chance of hitting and not for blind firing.</p>

<p>The Howitzer that has come to play a very
large part in the operations of the British is
the gun that is familiarly called "Mother"&mdash;a
gun of 9.2 inches calibre and which projects a
very weighty shell. The Germans have a corresponding
gun of a little larger bore.</p>

<p>Last of all there come the great guns of 15
and 16 inch calibre. These guns need concrete
foundations and cannot be set up in a hurry.
Fortunately&mdash;for them&mdash;the Germans had a
number of these foundations already prepared
in unsuspecting France and Belgium long before
the war. Our own gun of this size we call
"Grandmother." The shells that fall from the
German guns of the largest size we call by various
names&mdash;either "Bertha Krupps" from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
name of the proprietress of the great gun works
at Essen; or "Fat Berthas" for the same reason;
or "Jack Johnsons" from their hard-hitting
capacity; or "coal boxes," "black marias,"
etc., etc. The effect of these shells was terrific,
as may be imagined, but there were many occasions
when they pierced so deep into the soft
ground that a good deal of the force of their
explosion was lost. Of course for work against
forts there is nothing like them. They opened
the eyes of the world from their terrible destructive
force shown at Liége and Namur.</p>

<p>Akin to shells in their effects are the now
familiar bombs. These are of all varieties and
sizes. They range from the small hand grenade
that is about the size of an ordinary lemon and
is simply heaved into the opposing trench by
the soldiers, to the immense bombs weighing
two hundred and fifty pounds that are thrown
from trench mortars, or guns of short barrel
and very wide mouths. It was a long time before
the British army appreciated the value of
bombs and we could not get a supply of them.
The "Tommies" set to work to manufacture
them in the trenches and a good many lives were
lost there through premature explosions.</p>

<p>Practice is absolutely necessary before a man
is fit to be allowed to handle a live bomb. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
should be trained first of all to throw a tin
filled with stones, and learn the trick of letting
it go at the correct moment. The first time a
man throws a bomb he is simply anxious to
get rid of it without any regard for the time
the fuse has been burning. Most fuses now
are five seconds and that time must be calculated
to a nicety to get the best results. If a
bomb is thrown too soon, the enemy may pick
it up and throw it back&mdash;this has happened
many hundreds of times. It should be retained
in the hand during the first and second seconds
at least and then thrown so as to explode <span class="smcap">over</span>
the enemy trench on the fifth second. Our men
were taught to get out of the way of bombs
coming into the trenches if they could&mdash;there is
no use staying to be blown up under ordinary
trench conditions&mdash;but if they were under such
circumstances that they could not get out of
the way they were supposed to catch them and
throw them away, or throw them back as hastily
as possible. Men become experts in this just
as they do in catching base balls. Where a
bomb could not be picked up and endangered
the lives of men in the trench who could not
get away from it, men have often thrown their
bodies upon it, and thus, in a most gallant and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
self-sacrificing way, given their lives for their
comrades.</p>

<p>Of course catching them is out of the question
when it comes to the large bombs. Absence
of body then is better than all the presence
of mind. When they actually hit the trench&mdash;which
is a very difficult thing to do&mdash;they
do frightful damage. But when they miss
their mark they usually open up a lot of earth
either before or behind the trench, and perhaps
lay out a man or two with concussion.</p>

<p>Of the same variety are aerial torpedoes
which are simply bombs with flanges on their
tails to give them direction.</p>

<p>Sometimes the bombs that were sent over
were not H. E. in the sense that they exploded
a steel shell that sent its various pieces large
and small hurtling through the air, but were
simply large oil drums with a quantity of H. E.
in them. Men were killed right and left, not
from being hit with anything, but merely from
having been in the neighbourhood when they exploded.</p>

<p>Rifle grenades are a form of bomb on the
end of a stick that fits into the muzzle of the
rifle and is then discharged by means of a blank
cartridge. They are effective only at short distances.
Indeed, even with trench mortars, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
projectiles can seldom be hurled more than four
hundred yards, so that they are almost always
used on the fire trenches and are never directed
to trenches farther back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
GAS AND LIQUID FIRE</h2>


<p>A new and deadly form of warfare is the
use of <span class="smcap">Gas</span>. Until April, 1915, we knew
nothing about it and then we had to
face it to our great cost. We had no masks
and no apparatus of any kind to help us combat
it. Having been taken by surprise in an
engagement that almost cost us Calais, we set
to work to devise means to counteract it. The
method adopted is the helmet, made of cloth,
and very much like a fireman's smoke helmet.
It has large goggles similar to the ones that
motorists wear. The cloth is kept saturated
with a solution of ammonia which acts as a neutraliser
of the chlorine gas. A tube passes
through the cloth into the mouth, and through
this tube the air from the lungs is breathed out.
It is, of course, fatal to inhale air through it,
and all the air that is breathed in has to be inhaled
through the cloth of the helmet.</p>

<p>The importance of training the soldier to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
able to meet gas cannot be overemphasised. He
should be drilled frequently with the helmet on
to accustom him to the feeling of it, and alarms
should be sounded from time to time to teach
him to don the helmet as rapidly as possible.
In some of the military schools in France the
men were actually taken without helmets into
chambers where there was just enough gas to
make them realise it was there, and were then
sent into other chambers with a "deadly" mixture
of gas with their helmets on. This training
makes them realise the importance of helmets.</p>

<p>Many forms of helmets have been used from
time to time, and in this matter as in many
others we have learnt from our enemies. For
the most recent British mask contains the
"nosebox" or "beak" which conforms to the
German model. As in most other things, simplicity
is to be desired where it can be combined
with effectiveness, and it is the simplicity of
the cloth helmet with the tube that even to-day
commends it to many critics above the "box"
forms&mdash;those that require an independent supply
of oxygen. Where men such as gunners are
liable to be exposed to fumes for some considerable
length of time, either from cylinder gas or
from shells or even from tear shells, or must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
continue at their posts at any costs, an independent
fresh air supply is necessary.</p>

<p>Detailed instruction also should be given as
to what men are to do during and after the gas
attacks; for there are some forms of gas that
do not appear to affect the individual at all, and
then all of a sudden, when he begins to use his
limbs, he drops dead from heart failure. Instruction
on this subject must come from the
medical and chemical experts who have made a
close study of the effects of gas.</p>

<p>Allied to gas is <span class="smcap">Liquid Fire</span>. This fire is
projected in long streams from the nozzles of
pipes that come from a high pressure cylinder,
sometimes placed in the bottom of the trench,
and sometimes carried on the backs of special
men. These globules of burning oil that are
sent forth reach a distance of thirty or forty
feet from the nozzle of the pipe. The effect of
liquid fire is more terrible than words can tell,
and it requires great bravery on the part of
troops to have them advance in the face of these
streams.</p>

<p>Clouds of <span class="smcap">Smoke</span> as well as gas are used.
One of the ruses that was adopted at the battle
of Loos was to project smoke forward for a few
minutes until the enemy should become quite
used to it, and then send out streams and waves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of gas to take him unawares. These are frightful
methods of warfare which the Allies have
had to turn to in order not to allow the enemy,
from his violation of his pledged word, and
contrary to the rules of warfare, to gain an unfair
advantage. But there are many of us who
believe that no other enemy than the Germans
would have descended to these depths of infamy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
THE ATTACK&mdash;DEFENCE</h2>


<p>Sooner or later in the course of his trench
experience the soldier will be subjected
to an infantry attack. Artillery shelling,
aeroplane attacks, mining, etc., are part of
everyday's programme, but infantry attacks
come only now and then. They <i>may</i> come at
any time and the enemy is not in the habit of
announcing them beforehand. It is not likely
that they will occur in broad daylight without
any warning. If they are to be made then, they
will be preceded always by a concentrated artillery
preparation. Night is the danger time.
There are two periods of special danger&mdash;one,
the hour before sunrise, and the other the hour
after sunset. At these times there is sufficient
light for men to be able to see their way to advance
over almost any ground, and not sufficient
light for the defending force to be able to take
careful sight with their rifles and machine guns,
etc. Consequently these hours are the most
favourable for making an attack, and every one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
must be on the alert to ward them off. These
times are called "Stand tos" or properly
"Stand to arms." While they last, every officer
and every man of the front and support line
is on duty. Rifles are cleaned, inspected and
loaded, bombs, gas-masks, revolvers, bayonets,
etc., are got ready, and every one remains at his
post of duty. In the blackness of night and in
the broad light of day the danger is much less
and consequently some of the force can be relieved
for other tasks, during the night, or for
rest during the day.</p>

<p>Should an attack be made, it becomes the business
of the men in the trench to hold the enemy
off just as long as they can, at whatever cost to
themselves, while some one telegraphs back for
the supports and reserves, and possibly for the
assistance of the artillery. Trenches must never
be surrendered without giving these fresh men
a chance to regain the advantage, and should
the trench be lost, a counter attack must be immediately
arranged before the enemy has had
time to reverse the trenches and connect them
up by saps and communicating trenches with
his own system. No time must be lost, for the
longer the delay, the greater the difficulty of
making the counter attack successful.</p>

<p>As to the methods of holding the trench<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
against an infantry attack, it will be evident
that the men must take up their position on the
firing step and fire as rapidly and as steadily
as they can. Bombs should be kept and thrown
only when the enemy has got well within range
for them. Machine guns can do effective work
of course and the artillery should be communicated
with and they will open fire with shrapnel.
Where ammunition permits, a barrage or
curtain of fire should then be established behind
the enemy's front line to prevent him
bringing up reserves to take the place of those
that have fallen, and also to weaken him for
the time when a counter attack on him has to be
made. Star shells, that illuminate the ground,
will of course have been fired to give the machine
gunners and the rifle marksmen a better
chance to find their targets.</p>

<p>Obedience, steadiness and tenacity are required
of the men, and only training and experience
will develop these excellent soldierly
qualities. The poor type of soldier will either
forget to use his weapon altogether or else fire
wildly and uselessly. An infantry attack is not a
pleasant experience, but soldiers must be taught
to expect it, and that it will probably give them
the opportunity of using the final and greatest
weapon of the infantryman&mdash;the bayonet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
THE ATTACK&mdash;OFFENCE</h2>


<p>Trenches can only be considered as devices
for affording temporary protection
during the time that preparations are being
made for delivering an attack. No one
wants to remain in trenches for ever. At the
best it is a miserable kind of life, and from a
military point of view, it gets nowhere. Nor
is it capable of being maintained without great
loss in men. So costly did it become to us, and
so great was the monotony and the feeling of
helplessness, that we welcomed the word when
it came to us to deliver an attack. At least that
would bring us action, and give a variety to
life.</p>

<p>During the first year of the war, attacks had
almost always to be made without sufficient artillery
preparation. Even at the Battle of
Neuve Chapelle, where we assembled over 480
guns on a little more than a mile of front&mdash;a
greater collection than had ever been got together
in history&mdash;we had not sufficient artillery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
preparation for the attack that was to be
made. There were enough guns but not enough
shells to fire from them. The result was that
much of the enemy's wire was still intact when
the infantry rushed over, and the advance was
held up in certain important points where we
could be enfiladed.</p>

<p>We have learnt that the only method of delivering
an infantry attack against prepared
positions is to give them a thorough hammering
with shells. Every particle of wire should
be destroyed, so as to eliminate the risk of men
being shot down as they attempt to pass through
it. At the Battle of Loos our guns bombarded
their lines from Monday morning to Saturday
morning, and kept hammering at them so as not
to give them a chance to repair either their wire
or their parapets. An effective curtain of fire
was established at the same time to render it
impossible for them to bring food and supplies
up to the line that we were about to attack.
For the last ten minutes before the men actually
went over the parapet, there was a perfect tornado
of shells falling upon and behind their
lines. Any one who remained at his post alive
during the previous days would find it almost
impossible to continue there during this deluge.</p>

<p>If the artillery preparation is adequate, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
battle is half over. General Haig's successes
on the Somme, and the consequent German retreat
on a large scale, have been due, in the first
place to the excellent work of the gunners. Of
course the gunners themselves have been dependent
on many other branches of the service
pre-eminent among which is the aeroplane
corps. Targets are seldom seen by the gunners
who have to depend for their information on
the men who can fly ahead and come back with
actual photographs of the positions to be bombarded.
Too great emphasis cannot be placed
upon the work of these gallant flying men. During
the battles of the Somme, they have not only
been doing this reconnaissance work for the
gunners, but they have been flying very low
after they reached the enemy territory and
using their machine guns on the advancing or
retreating infantry. So low did they fly, indeed,
that the enemy did not risk firing upon
them with their guns for fear of hitting their
own men. They were fairly safe as far as the
opposing infantry was concerned for the man
in the machine is well protected from below and
at the sides from rifle bullets.</p>

<p>While the artillery is active, the junior artillery,
the bomb gunners must also get to work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
to throw over as much H. E. as possible to break
down the resistance of the enemy.</p>

<p>Then again there is the gas, which has now
come to be used as a definite part of an offensive.
Gas is conveyed to the trenches in large
drums, under pressure, and at the proper moment
is liberated in waves against the enemy.
It should be in the hands of trained men who
can be trusted not to liberate it a moment before
the time comes.</p>

<p>While gas has proved very effective under
certain circumstances&mdash;and almost decided the
fate of Calais early in 1915&mdash;yet it is obviously
dependent upon the weather and especially the
wind. Even if the direction of the wind is correct
for the use of gas, the kind of wind may not
be suitable at the moment. The wind must not
be high nor squally, but needs to be low and
gentle, just sufficient to carry the gas across to
the opposing trenches without dissipating it on
the journey. Then again it must be remembered
that it can seldom reach the gunners who
may open up intensive fire on the trenches from
which it is being liberated, burst the drums and
make the place untenable. Of course all the
men who are employed in liberating gas should
be warned to have their helmets in position to
guard against these emergencies, and also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
against leaks in the drums. Gas masks must be
tested daily to see that they do not admit any
of this deadly poison.</p>

<p>In addition to these preparations, a good
many reconnaissance parties must be sent night
after night out into No Man's Land to map it
thoroughly, place directing boards there, dig
small saps to facilitate an advance, and learn
the condition of what remains of the enemy
wire. This work is difficult and dangerous, and
must be given to trustworthy, brave, resourceful
men. For it must be remembered that the
enemy will probably come out into this neutral
territory at night to try and learn the plans of
the opposing side, just as they are trying to
learn his plans. Many bloody conflicts have
taken place out there under cover of darkness
when the patrol from one side has entered into
conflict with the patrol from the other.</p>

<p>Those in charge of the attack will arrange
that at a specified time the bombardment will
cease, and the men leap over the parapets. This
time is usually arranged for, say, one minute
after six, or thirteen minutes after eight&mdash;some
time which the enemy cannot guess accurately.
During the final awful ten minutes, the finishing
touches are given to rifles and bombs and revolvers.
Then exactly at the appointed time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the electric buzzers in the trenches sound the
signal to advance. The first man over the parapet
is always an officer. Unlike the Germans,
we do not drive our men but expect them to follow
us, and this accounts in part for the very
severe casualties that have been suffered by
British officers.</p>

<p>Where the distance between trenches is short,
say, a couple of hundred yards, it is covered as
fast as men can run. It is a veritable race with
death; for the enemy must not be allowed to
recover from the bombardment in time to get
his machine guns up into position again before
the infantry arrives before his trenches. The
attacking infantry must throw themselves down
into the trenches and begin work at once with
bomb and bayonet. Since the enemy has adopted
the plan of having his dugouts deep down
in the earth, it is a little easier to reach him
before he is able to emerge. In this work bombs
are most effective. All of the enemy communicating
trenches must be effectively barricaded
or protected by bombers and riflemen to keep
him from bringing up any reserves and thus
taking the attacking force from a flank. In an
attack of this kind the ground cannot be covered
too rapidly, and no thought must be given
to cover.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>But when attacks have to be made over long
distances, the plan is either to dig out saps that
will reach to within a reasonable charging distance
of the enemy, or else have the infantry
proceed at a moderate and steady pace, so as
not to arrive at their objective winded and useless
for bayonet work. The principle of having
sectional rushes while neighbouring sections
open rapid fire will be found useful.</p>

<p>The German method of advance is characterised
by the close order formation, the British
by the open order formation. The German
training is such that he cannot act independently
to any very great degree, but needs to feel
the support of another strong arm near him, if
possible touching him. They attack in waves
of men packed so closely together that it is
impossible to miss them if you get a shot at
them at all, and of course they are ideal marks
for machine guns. But in the British and
French armies men are trained to be self-reliant
and to advance even when they seem to be
alone. An interval of three paces is usually
maintained between individuals, and that renders
them less of a target for marksmen. They
are also trained to take command of other men
should their officers or non-commissioned officers
be put out of action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Should any of the enemy wires be still intact,
they must be cut by the first comers so as not
to hold up the main attack. This is done by ordinary
wire cutters&mdash;which every man is supposed
to carry as part of his equipment&mdash;or
else by a new device that is attached to certain
rifles. By means of this a number of the wires
are caught together and then when the rifle is
fired the bullet cuts them and a passage through
is made.</p>

<p>If the trench should be successfully taken and
all the enemy disposed of, the first work to be
done is to "reverse" it, and connect it up by
communicating trenches with the old position.
For this work engineers are sent immediately
behind the infantry, and they carry with them
quantities of sand bags and shovels and picks
and wire, etc., with which to complete this task.
Of course the infantry must also help, and for
this purpose it will be as well for each man to
take with him a few sandbags on his back&mdash;not
enough to encumber him, but sufficient to be of
service in putting up hasty defences.</p>

<p>The test of the success of the action will come
as soon as the enemy is able to organise a counter-attack.
He will know the range of the trench
to a nicety and will not be slow to hurl the
weight of his shells against it. Then, too, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
will try to bring up reserves, who with bayonet
and bomb will attack their old position. For
many weary hours the infantry may be busy on
this task of repelling counter attacks, and consolidating
their new position.</p>

<p>So many details have to be cared for in an
attack that it is well to rehearse it thoroughly
beforehand and to see that every individual
knows just exactly where he is supposed to be
and what he is to do. Only in that way will confusion
be avoided. It will be necessary also for
the attackers to wear distinguishing marks in
the form of a white band on the arm or a white
piece of cloth on the back if the attack is to be
made in the darkness or with poor light.</p>

<p>The question of prisoners inevitably comes
up. What is to be done with them? How are
they to be taken care of? It will be seen that
this is a big problem in an attack where men
cannot be disengaged from their tasks of taking
trenches without greatly weakening the operation.
To tell off men to look after prisoners
when every man is needed to break down the
resistance that is still being offered by others
of the enemy, is a procedure obviously surrounded
with dangers. And yet, in the interests
of humanity it has to be done, for the only
other alternative is to take no prisoners. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the battle of Loos many of the German prisoners
that we took came to us in embarrassing
mobs. They were weak and hungry and required
little persuasion to lay down their arms.
Under these conditions we could manage a great
many prisoners with a few armed men. Where
they surrendered in ones and twos we found
there was a disposition on the part of some of
our troops to disengage themselves from the
battle to lead them back. A man is naturally
proud of the fact that he has taken a prisoner
and wants to deliver him himself. But we insisted
that they be turned over at the earliest
opportunity to others who were in charge of
small numbers of prisoners, and that as soon
as possible they be given into the charge of men
who were slightly wounded, but who could still
be relied on to give a good account of themselves
if trouble arose. It is also a good thing
to have a quantity of loose telephone wire about&mdash;as
almost always happens in a battle&mdash;and
wind this round the prisoners, making sure that
they keep their hands in the air. Even barbed
wire will do, though it is not so comfortable
for the prisoners concerned, and it may be necessary
to relax the rule about keeping both
hands up!</p>

<p>Raids are attacks on a small scale, and on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
definite portion of the enemy's line. They are
usually carried out by parties varying in number
from twenty to a hundred commanded by
one or more officers. Almost the same preparation
as for an attack is necessary in most
cases to break down the barbed wire before the
lines. But in some cases they are carried out
as surprises and then other means must be relied
on to overcome the difficulties of the barbed
wire. As in the case of attacks, rehearsals must
precede the operation itself so that every man
will know exactly what he is supposed to do and
where he is supposed to be. In a recent raid
during the time that the snow was on the
ground, the Canadians secured a number of
women's nightgowns and put them on over their
uniforms. In this remarkable garb they proceeded
over No Man's Land to visit the German
lines.</p>

<p>If artillery preparation has been given, that
must be depended on to have broken the wires
and the thing to be done then is to reach the
enemy parapets before they have time to recover
and bring the machine guns into action.
But by far the greater number of raids come
as surprises to the enemy. They do not hear
the men beyond their parapets lying on their
stomachs and busily cutting the wires with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
snips. The first they know of it is when a bomb
lands in the trench or else the body of one of
the attacking infantrymen, as he enters their
stronghold to begin his work of destruction. In
raiding parties, more than at any other time it
is well to remember the adage that "silence is
golden," and that the best results can only be
obtained if every man is determined to follow
his instructions to the very letter. If the party
is cut off by superior forces it must make up its
mind as to what it is going to do, though most
men, I am sure, will prefer to fight to the death
rather than surrender.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
EQUIPMENT FOR THE FIELD</h2>


<p>The question is often asked by prospective
soldiers as to what is the irreducible minimum
that a man should take to war, in
the way of equipment. I say irreducible, for it
is to the interest of the infantryman who has
to carry practically all his belongings on his
back, to reduce his load as much as possible consistent
with efficiency and comfort. The tailors
in London who undertook the tasks of equipping
young officers for the trenches, having
more interest in making sales than anything
else, did their best to persuade their victims
that the omission of one of dozens of things
they proposed would expose them to very grave
risks. No one could possibly have carried all
the equipment they suggested and no Army
Service Corps would ever have been able to
handle it as baggage. Some of the men who
fell victims to these outfitters went to France
looking more like "Xmas trees" than anything
else, for it was only when there was no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
room on their bodies to hang anything that these
excellent gentlemen were satisfied, and let them
depart.</p>

<p>In this list that I am now giving, I propose
to deal with the equipment of the soldier first
and then add to it the items that seem to me to
be essential for the Officer.</p>

<p>First of all there is the rifle, the soldier's best
friend. It should be cherished and cared for
as though his life depended on it&mdash;as it frequently
may. We used to inspect the rifles of
the men at least twice a day in the trenches, and
any sign of neglect was at once dealt with. It
must be kept free from all rust and dirt, well
oiled and polished, and with every part of the
mechanism in first class working condition.
Any text book on musketry will give the information
necessary for the effective care of the
rifle. We found that the breech of the rifle was
often in danger of becoming fouled through
mud or sand. Accordingly we advised the men
to keep that part covered whenever the rifle was
not in action. Small khaki cloths with snap
buttons were made, but where these were not
obtainable, the leg of a sock served quite as
well. But it must be easily removable.</p>

<p>Rifles are sometimes fouled through putting
into them cartridges that are rusty or muddy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
All cartridges should be cleaned before being
inserted. Now it is obvious that time cannot be
taken for this task during an engagement, and
so it must be done before the rifle is to be used.
As the cartridges come from the factory they
are perfectly clean; but if they are carried
about for days and weeks in the carriers on the
equipment they get very dirty. Officers must
inspect them from time to time and see that
damaged ones are sent away and not allowed
to be fired through the rifles. No care can be
too great. It is a pitiful sight to see a man in
action with a rifle that has become clogged
through carelessness. It is a good thing to give
rewards for those who consistently present
clean rifles for inspection, and to punish those
who do not. When a man realises how much he
is dependent on his rifle he will be certain to
take care of it.</p>

<p>The next thing is the bayonet. I have said
that all infantry work leads up to the use of
the bayonet, and so, if a man is to be ready for
this final test, his bayonet must be in good
shape. Of course there is not much to get out
of order, but there are a few movable parts that
must be kept oiled, and the blade itself which
must be kept clean. It is a slight courtesy that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
you can pay your enemy, that you give him
clean, instead of rusty, steel.</p>

<p>Another weapon that has proved itself indispensable
in this war is the entrenching tool. It
is a small instrument with a detachable handle,
and the head itself has a shovel at one end and
a pick at the other. It is a wonderful little tool
for hasty entrenching and no attack should be
made without it. It has been the means of saving
many, many lives in this war.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the perfidy of the enemy has
made necessary another addition to the equipment
of every soldier, and that is the gas mask.
The best kind consists of heavy khaki cloth,
kept wet with a solution to counteract and neutralise
the chlorine in the gas, and equipped
with goggles very much like what motorists
wear, and a tube that enters the mouth. The
air to be breathed is drawn in through the cloth
itself, and the air that has been used is driven
out through the tube. It is not a comfortable
process but it is considerably better than imbibing
deadly gas.</p>

<p>Of course a water bottle must be carried and
must always be kept clean. On every possible
occasion the soldier should wash it out with hot
water and some form of disinfectant. Men
should be discouraged from rushing to their water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
bottles for drinks at all times, especially
when they are on the march. Thirst is a thing
that we can easily control if we will.</p>

<p>We learnt that it was an excellent practice
to have strapped about the equipment in a place
where they could easily be got at, two sandbags.
They are not heavy or bulky to carry, and if
hasty cover is needed they will be found invaluable.</p>

<p>Lists of the clothes necessary are given in
every military manual, and it will be well to
follow the one for the special army to which
you belong. Besides, the clothing necessary
will vary according to the climate in which the
troops have to serve. Quite obviously the
equipment for the Philippines will be different
from the equipment for France. But we found
that it was a good plan to have warm underclothes
for the winter, not the heaviest variety,
but reasonably heavy. It is better and more
convenient to add to the clothing should occasion
warrant it rather than carry heavy underclothes
all the time. In summer the underclothing
should be light. But whatever the season,
a change should be carried in the pack on
the back. In the case of socks two or three
emergency pairs should be in the pack. These
socks should be made of wool, preferably undyed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
and should be thick and heavy for all
times. I am aware that it is much nicer to have
thin silk socks for the summer time, but they
are not intended for marching in nor yet for
use with heavy military boots.</p>

<p>Two pairs of boots should be taken, one pair
on the feet and one pair in the pack. Tennis
shoes should also be carried to put on at times
to rest the feet.</p>

<p>I need scarcely indicate what toilet articles
are needed, for they are the same on service
as would be taken for a week-end at the seaside.
But I would add that it is a good thing to include
a cake of strong carbolic soap to discourage
the lice.</p>

<p>Emergency bandages, sewn into the tunic,
may be the means of saving your life.</p>

<p>Some means must be adopted for protecting
the ears from the noises of the rifles and bombs
and shells. Cotton wool will serve, but a much
better device is on the market, called "Ear Defenders."
They are small vulcanite cylinders
that are inserted into the ears. Near the end of
the cylinder there is a diaphragm of fine gauze
which is pushed up against the wall by the
sound waves created by great noises (thus protecting
the drum of the ear) while they do not
respond at all to the waves from small sounds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Consequently it is quite possible to hear the
words of a person speaking, and not be affected
by the noise of the guns. I have used them myself
and can vouch for their efficacy, though it
does take a little time to become used to them.</p>

<p>Then again nearly every soldier will need a
wrist watch. These should be luminous, for
there is much waste of time involved in striking
a match or going to a lamp to see the time. It
pays to buy a good watch, and by all means get
a removable cover for the glass face, for glasses
easily break, and it is difficult to get them repaired
on service.</p>

<p>I do not intend this list to be exhaustive, but
to contain the most important things that a soldier
will need to include in this equipment.</p>

<p>Officers are allowed more baggage, and will
need more, but the mistake must not be made
of overloading or taking unnecessary things.
They will need a canvas valise and a sleeping
bag to go with it, and, if possible, a very light
mattress, weighing not more than a few pounds.
A canvas water bucket and a wash basin, and a
change of uniform are very necessary. As to
weapons, I found that the Colt automatic was
very serviceable. Swords are of course not carried
in France. They are a nuisance for most
purposes, though they do make excellent toasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
forks. In action we led our men, equipped
only with revolver and cane. In raids and
trench work a handy instrument is the trench
dagger&mdash;a knife of about nine inches long, ending
in a handle that has openings for the four
fingers to go through, thus serving as a
"knuckle duster." Field glasses are essential
and indeed they should be supplied to some of
the non-commissioned officers as well. Nothing
under four nor over eight diameters should be
chosen. Below that figure they do not magnify
enough, and above that figure they magnify too
much. Six or seven is ideal for the infantryman.</p>

<p>Some form of collapsible periscope may be
carried, but most of us discarded the ones we
had bought in England in favour of the simple
ones that I have described in another place.</p>

<p>I would utter again the warning against loading
up with too many things. Get few things
but get good ones and keep them good is the
best advice that I can give.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
TRICKS FOR THE TRENCHES</h2>


<p>A closing word should be said on the
subject of trench ruses. As in every
other form of warfare, deception must
be practised on the enemy. He must be made
to believe you are doing things that you are not
doing and that you propose doing things that
are not in your plans at all. Any number of
these ruses will occur to the minds of my readers,
and I want to mention a few of them that
we actually tried.</p>

<p>One of the best ruses is to let the enemy get
hold of fake orders. These can be placed on
bodies immediately after an action and there
will be a good chance of the enemy accepting
them as genuine. We have reason to believe
that some of the prisoners that we took came
over for the purpose of letting false orders fall
into our hands. It is pretty hard on the individual
to make him the goat in this way and I
do not recommend it.</p>

<p>Making elaborate preparations for an attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
in one spot, and then actually attacking from another
point when his reserves have been drawn
to the first point, also used to work well.</p>

<p>It is well to learn the calls and signals of the
enemy for use during an attack, and thus to
throw his men into disorder. There have been
Germans in this war who carried out the daring
ruse of appearing in our lines in the uniforms
of staff officers and giving orders to our
men. They were brave individuals and scarcely
seem to merit the swift punishment that came
to them on detection.</p>

<p>In the trenches it was sometimes necessary
to move about the few men that we had and to
keep them firing first in one place and then in
another to convey the impression that we were
in considerable force.</p>

<p>Ruses had to be adopted to discover snipers.
On one occasion I needed to find a sniper who
had just killed three of my men, and was such
an excellent shot that he broke my periscope.
For this purpose I made a dummy man out of
sand bags and had a soldier put him cautiously
above the parapet (head only) while I observed
from a neighbouring bay. I detected him from
the dust that his bullet raised from his parapet,
and a few well aimed artillery shots put him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and his loop hole out of business. My poor
dummy was badly wounded in the process.</p>

<p>The Turks in Gallipoli used to paint some of
their snipers a green colour and send them out
between the lines among the small bushes.</p>

<p>A pretended retreat will sometimes lure the
enemy from his trenches to destruction.</p>

<p>Sending out patrols in one section to draw
fire while careful reconnaissance work is being
done at another spot will sometimes find him
off his guard.</p>

<p>Dummy guns, of course, have played a large
part, and have been responsible for the waste
of a great deal of ammunition. They are placed
where they can be observed by the aeroplanes,
who promptly report their presence. It is said
that at the Dardanelles the forts once opened
fire on the battleship <i>Queen Elizabeth</i>.
After a while they sank her&mdash;and her guns
floated off! It is telling no secret now to say
that many of the units in the British navy had
duplicates constructed out of old vessels. Their
business was to draw fire to themselves while
other craft did the work. Hence the wooden
guns. They served another purpose as well, for
it was very difficult for spies to inform Germany
where the real fighting ships were at any
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>In short, the whole business is to "get the
enemy's goat." Keep him guessing. Wear him
down with worrying. Break his nerve and spoil
his sleep, that his physical resistance may be
weakened. On the other hand, learn to estimate
the intention on the enemy. Do not underrate
him. In all cases and under all circumstances
follow out the excellent motto of the
Boy Scouts&mdash;</p>
